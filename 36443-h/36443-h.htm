<h1><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>King of the Air</h1>
<h2><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I—MR. GREATOREX IS ASTONISHED</h2>
<p>
Mr. John Greatorex was very
wealthy, and very obstinate. He had
made a large fortune as a manufacturer of chemicals,
but disclaimed any knowledge of chemistry.
He had dabbled a little in mechanics, and was
convinced that he possessed an accurate practical
knowledge of its applications. Consequently,
when his new motor-car arrived, he saw no necessity
to take a chauffeur with him on its trial spin.
He was like a child with a new toy, jealous of
participation.
</p>
<p>
“My dear,” said Mrs. Greatorex, as she handed
him his motor goggles, “are you sure you will not
take Timothy? What if it breaks down?”
</p>
<p>
“My <em>love</em>,” said Mr. Greatorex in his emphatic
way, “I do not <em>want</em> Timothy. It will not
break down. If it <em>does</em>, I flatter myself I am
<em>competent</em> to make any <em>necessary</em> repairs. I shall
be back at seven-thirty—in good time for dinner;
and I <em>hope and trust</em> the soup will <em>not</em> be cold.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
</p>
<p>
He gave a preliminary <em>honk! honk!</em> looking
round with a smile that plainly said, “There!
you see that <em>everything</em> is in order!” Then he
steered the car accurately down the drive to the
road.
</p>
<p>
His house lying in the heart of the country,
Mr. Greatorex did not fear to meet milestones
in the shape of policemen with stop-watches,
who would take his number and afterwards confront
him in court. In a minute or two the car
was whirling along the road at a rate which, it
is to be feared, gravely exceeded the speed limit.
All went merry as a marriage-bell, and Mr.
Greatorex was at the height of exhilaration and
satisfaction, when, just as he was mounting the
acclivity of Five Oaks Bridge, without even a
click in warning, the machine came to a dead
stop. Mr. Greatorex put the engine out of
gear, then tried to start it by turning the starting
handle; but finding this of no avail he clapped
on the brake, skipped out of the car, removed his
goggles and his gloves, and set about making an
examination.
</p>
<p>
On the other side of the bridge, sitting on
the bank of the stream, was a boy, gazing with
round eyes at a float that hung from a line
attached to a long home-made rod of yew. He
had heard the clatter of the motor-car as it came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
along the road; he was aware that the noise
had suddenly ceased; but, being a lad of great
concentration, he did not give a thought to what
was happening out of sight at the further end
of the bridge. He had come out for an afternoon’s
fishing; two or three fat carp lay beside
him on the bank; and noticing at this moment
a slight movement of the float, he was soon
oblivious of everything except the fish on his
hook.
</p>
<p>
Half an hour passed. Three more fish had
rewarded his patience; then, satisfied with his
catch, the boy rose, methodically wound up his
line, and, leaving reel, rod and basket on the
bank, walked up on to the bridge, to investigate
the meaning of sundry strange noises he had
heard, vaguely, in the intervals between the
bites.
</p>
<p>
As he gained the foot of the bridge, where a
motor-car stood somewhat askew across the road,
he caught sight of a pair of brown boots projecting
from beneath the machine. Nothing
but the boots was visible; but they moved, and
it was clear that they shod the feet of some living
person, for there came puffs and grunts and
explosive monosyllables resembling those he had
sometimes heard on the golf-links near his home.
</p>
<p>
The boy leant against the parapet, stuck his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
hands into his pockets, and watched. By and
by there was an ejaculation of peculiar vehemence;
the boots moved out into the road, followed
by a pair of grey-trousered legs, a soiled
and rumpled motor-coat, and a very red and
dirty face; the boy took especial note of a black
patch in the very centre of a shiny skull.
</p>
<p>
Puffing and blowing, Mr. Greatorex crawled
from under his new car, and stood upon his feet—a
rather disreputable-looking object—staring
wrathfully at the offending car. He had not
perceived the small spectator.
</p>
<p>
“Wish I <em>had</em> brought Timothy!” he muttered.
“<em>Confound</em> the brute!”
</p>
<p>
He looked at his grimy hands, at his mud-stained
clothes, up the road, down the road, and
finally at the boy, who had at last made an
impression on his retina.
</p>
<p>
“Hi, boy!” he said.
</p>
<p>
The boy approached with a shy smile. Mr.
Greatorex scowled, conscious of his plight.
</p>
<p>
“Boy, tell me, and don’t <em>grin</em>, is there a smith
anywhere in this neighbourhood?”
</p>
<p>
“In the village, sure, measter.”
</p>
<p>
“Where is the village?”
</p>
<p>
“About three miles away, over yonder.”
</p>
<p>
“God bless me! Three miles! Well, look
here, boy, I’ll give you <em>sixpence</em> to run there and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
send the smith back—behind a horse, on a bicycle,
<em>anyhow</em>—to mend this confounded machine.
I’m twenty miles away from <em>home</em>, you understand,
and I shall be <em>late</em> for dinner. I’ll make
it a <em>shilling</em> if the smith is here within an
hour.”
</p>
<p>
The boy looked up into the wrathful face and
smiled again.
</p>
<p>
“Would ’ee like me to mend un for ’ee?
’Twould maybe save time.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Greatorex stared.
</p>
<p>
“<em>You</em> mend it! ’Pon my word!”
</p>
<p>
And then he burst into a roar of laughter
which carried away his ill-humour, for Mr.
Greatorex was normally a very good-tempered
person.
</p>
<p>
The situation was, in truth, amusing. The
boy was a little fellow under four feet high. He
had a round chubby face, not free from stains.
He wore corduroy breeches much too large for
him, big clumping boots, and a flannel shirt open
at the neck. His blue eyes peeped up from
beneath a large, soft, much-discoloured straw
hat. And this little urchin had actually offered
to mend a motor-car with which Mr. Greatorex,
with all his knowledge of mechanism, had been
struggling for half an hour in vain!
</p>
<p>
Mr. Greatorex laughed again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
</p>
<p>
“Come, cut along, youngster,” he said genially.
“Let me see how <em>fast</em> you can run.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll mend un if you give me leave. ’Twill
save time,” persisted the boy.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Greatorex pulled out his watch. What
a joke, he thought—this sprat of a boy offering
to tackle his huge motor-car! It was only a
little after five; there might still be time to
fetch the smith, get the repairs made, and yet
reach home by half-past seven. A little rest
would not come amiss after his exertions. Why
not let the youngster try his hand—for the fun
of it?
</p>
<p>
“Well then, <em>fire</em> away, my young engineer.
I’ve been at it half an hour, <em>confound</em> the thing!”
</p>
<p>
“What have ’ee done, measter?”
</p>
<p>
“Done? Everything! Examined the sparking
plugs: <em>they’re</em> all right. Wires from battery:
<em>they’re</em> all right. Battery itself, <em>that’s</em> all right.
Plenty of petrol in the tank. <em>Every</em>thing’s all
right, hang it, and yet the thing <em>won’t</em> go!”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you worrit, measter. Give me a lend
of your tools.”
</p>
<p>
The boy’s cocksureness again amused Mr.
Greatorex, who seated himself on the parapet of
the bridge, and mopped his perspiring face, smiling
pleasantly. Though past fifty he was still
young at heart, and very ready to be amused. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
took out a pipe, filled and lit it, and puffed away,
with an expression of serene contentment on his
rubicund dirty face.
</p>
<p>
The boy flung off his hat and disappeared.
Metallic sounds came from the interior of the car.
</p>
<p>
“How are you getting on, boy?” asked Mr.
Greatorex after some ten minutes.
</p>
<p>
There was no answer.
</p>
<p>
Five minutes passed.
</p>
<p>
“Find it rather too <em>much</em> for you, eh?” said
Mr. Greatorex, looking more amused than ever.
</p>
<p>
Still there was no answer.
</p>
<p>
“Got everything you want?” he asked again.
</p>
<p>
But the boy made no reply; only the sound
of knocking and screwing continued.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Greatorex laughed aloud.
</p>
<p>
“Come,” he said, getting up and standing
with legs astraddle a foot or two from the car,
“you mustn’t make <em>too</em> long a <em>job</em> of it, you
know.” Then he chuckled.
</p>
<p>
Five minutes afterwards the boy crawled out.
Mr. Greatorex laughed again as he surveyed the
grimy little fellow. A great patch of black
surrounded one eye, where he had rubbed his
knuckles.
</p>
<p>
“All right now, measter,” said the boy.
</p>
<p>
“What! Come, my lad, you’ve <em>had your</em>
turn; now run along and fetch the smith.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
</p>
<p>
“Bean’t no need. She’ll go now.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Greatorex looked impressed, stepped to
the front of the car, and turned the handle; to
his amazement the engines started. He sprang
into the car, threw the engines into gear, and was
still more amazed when, releasing the clutch pedal,
he found that the car moved.
</p>
<p>
“Better take off the brake, measter,” said the boy.
</p>
<p>
“Why, yes, certainly,” said Mr. Greatorex,
with a preoccupied air, and the car mounted
the incline, spun across the bridge, and ran easily
down the road. Then Mr. Greatorex stopped
it and turned round.
</p>
<p>
“Hi, boy!” he shouted. The boy picked up
his hat, stuck it on his head, and approached.
</p>
<p>
“Look here, youngster,” said Mr. Greatorex,
“the car is all <em>right</em>!”
</p>
<p>
“Told ’ee so, measter.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Greatorex roared.
</p>
<p>
“You’re a wonderful little chap. Bless my
soul, how did you <em>do</em> it?”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll show ’ee if you’ll get out.”
</p>
<p>
“No thank ’ee. I’ve already had half an hour
at it, and I’m as black as a nigger. What was
wrong?”
</p>
<p>
“A bit of grit was stuck in the petrol spray
nozzle, so you couldn’t get no petrol into the
carburetter.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” said Mr. Greatorex blankly. “What’s
your name?”
</p>
<p>
“Tom Dorrell.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t happen to be manager of a motor-works,
I suppose?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” said the boy, unconscious of the genial
sarcasm.
</p>
<p>
“Where d’you live?”
</p>
<p>
“In the village yonder,” said Tom, pointing
ahead.
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Ah! Look <em>here</em>, my lad, why aren’t
you at school?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, ‘cos ’tis holidays,” he replied with a
grin. “Feyther didn’t want me, so I came out
to fish.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, indeed. And who’s your father?”
</p>
<p>
“He be the smith you wanted me to fetch;
but there warn’t no need.”
</p>
<p>
“So it appears! I say, my lad, how <em>old</em> are
you?”
</p>
<p>
“Twelve, and I’m in the sixth standard.”
</p>
<p>
“You are, are you? And how long have
you been mending motor-cars?”
</p>
<p>
“Not so very long. I help feyther now and
again; motor-cars are always breaking down,
and he has mended a rare lot of ’em.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah! And how much would he have charged
for mending this one?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
</p>
<p>
“About two shillings, I reckon; it wasn’t a
very hard job.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! Well, here’s two shillings for you.
Don’t spend it <em>all</em> on sweets.”
</p>
<p>
“Not me,” said the boy with a grin. “I’m
saving up, I am.”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed! What for?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, for heaps of things. I want a model
of a four-coupled bogie tank engine, and a model
of a turbine steamer, and a motor bicycle——”
</p>
<p>
“Steady, youngster. That’s rather a <em>large</em>
order, isn’t it? You’ve got a fancy for mechanics,
eh!”
</p>
<p>
“Mechanics! Not me! That’s what they
teach in the seventh standard. I like engines, I
do—machines that’ll go. I’m going to be an
engineer some day—if I can; feyther says it
costs a mint of money, and he hasn’t got much,
and he says he don’t hold with flying too high,
and I’d much better be a smith. But there’s
nothing new in smith’s work: you just go on
shoeing horses, and sticking fellies on wheels, and
mending prams and motor-cars now and then.
I want to do something new, I do.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah! What’s your father’s name?”
</p>
<p>
“Dorrell, same as mine.”
</p>
<p>
“Naturally. And what do you call your
village?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
</p>
<p>
“Barton Abbas.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, Tom, here’s your two shillings. You’ve
got a bank-book, I suppose.”
</p>
<p>
“Rather. I’ve got three pounds fourteen
and ninepence; this makes sixteen and ninepence.
I shall have another sixpence on Saturday for
cleaning pa’son’s bicycle; that’ll make seventeen
and threepence. Pa’son gives me sixpence a
week.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re getting quite rich, you know. Well,
Tom, thanks to you I <em>shall</em> get home in time for
dinner.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m pretty hungry,” said Tom. “I guess
it’s past my tea-time.”
</p>
<p>
“No doubt it is. <em>Strawberry</em> jam, eh?”
</p>
<p>
“No. Mother says that’s too dear. We have
rhubarb and marrow, growed in the garden.”
</p>
<p>
“And very good stuff, too. <em>By George!</em> I
haven’t had marrow jam for forty years.”
</p>
<p>
“You be pretty old then: older than feyther.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, d’you know, Tom, I am <em>several years</em>
younger than I was two hours ago. Good-bye!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>CHAPTER II—HERR SCHWAB</h2>
<p>
One spring day, rather more than six years
after the meeting of Mr. Greatorex and
Tom Dorrell by Five Oaks Bridge, a shabby pony
cart was jogging along the road that led from
the little railway station of Midfont, through
the sleepy village of the same name, to Midfont
House, the rural retreat to which Mr. Greatorex
betook himself from his business in the great
manufacturing town of Burlingham some dozen
miles away. The sole occupant of the cart was
a large florid man of about forty-five, who eyed
the surroundings curiously through heavy gold-rimmed
spectacles, the sluggish pony he drove
requiring little attention.
</p>
<p>
His costume, no less than his spectacles, was
strangely out of keeping with the cart. That
would have been a fit setting for a farm-hand, or
a carrier, or some other wearer of fustian. But
its present occupant was attired in a well-cut
grey frock-coat, silk lined, a glossy silk hat, a lilac-coloured
necktie in which flashed a diamond
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>
pin, and trousers of large check pattern. His
hands were gloved in brown kid; between his
teeth he held a long cigar.
</p>
<p>
He looked about him with intention. Unfenced
fields stretched on either side of the road.
Every now and again the driver would pull up,
stand on the seat, and throw a searching glance
around. Then, muttering under his breath
words that were certainly strange to that part
of the English midlands, he would drive on again,
looking to right and left as before.
</p>
<p>
By and by he came to a part of the road where
a long wooden fence on the right-hand side
indicated an enclosure. To this the driver gave
his whole attention, and when the fence was
broken by a wide wooden gate, within which a
carriage drive ran past a little lodge and between
hedges of evergreen, he pulled up, alighted from
the cart, and, leading the pony by the nose, went
to the gate and gave the bell-pull a vigorous tug.
It might have been noticed that he walked a
little lame.
</p>
<p>
In response to his summons a man came to the
gate—a young man, thin, clean-shaven, with a
slight cast in one eye. He was bareheaded, wore
a red waistcoat over a flannel shirt, and brown
corduroy breeches, supported by a leather belt
and somewhat creased above brown leggings.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
</p>
<p>
“So!” said the driver of the pony cart, as
the lodgekeeper rested his arms on the second
bar of the gate and looked at him. “Zis, my
goot friend, is Midfont House?”
</p>
<p>
“You’ve got it right, guv’nor.”
</p>
<p>
“So! Zen I ask, is Mr. Thomas Dorrell at
home?”
</p>
<p>
“Nice day, guv’nor.”
</p>
<p>
“I zank you, yes, it is not bad. Mr. Thomas
Dorrell——”
</p>
<p>
“No; my name’s Timothy Ball—T. B. on
my collars.”
</p>
<p>
“I zank you. Mr. Thomas Dorrell——”
</p>
<p>
“This ’ere place belongs to Mr. John Greatorex,
Esquire, J.P., and he ain’t at home, bein’
engaged in trying a bad case of stealin’ lamb
and mint-sauce not a many miles from ’ere.”
</p>
<p>
“My goot friend, I do not mind; I like it. I
come not to see Mr. Greatorex, I come to see
Mr. Thomas Dorrell——”
</p>
<p>
“Now, look ’ere, guv’nor, we’ve had chaps
’ere before with cheap watches and dear books
and thingummies of all sorts, and I tell you
straight, we don’t encourage ’em; in fact, I’ve
got strict orders from Mr. Greatorex, J.P., to
set the dog on any such that won’t take no for
an answer.”
</p>
<p>
“My goot friend, you mistake. Vizout doubt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
I carry, some days, books, editions de luxe, and
vatches and ozer zinks, but to-day—no, no.
Look, here is my carte——”
</p>
<p>
“And a rum-lookin’ ramshackle turn-out it
is,” quoth Timothy, ignoring the piece of pasteboard
and eyeing the vehicle disdainfully. “I
wonder you ain’t ashamed to come out in a ‘at
like that, togged up to the nines, quite a torf,
and your pony as looks as if he ain’t had a currycomb
on his hide for a month o’ Sundays.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, you mistake me all ze time. Ze bony,
he is not mine; I hire him to bring me to Midfont
House. Here is my carte, my friend. Take
it to Mr. Thomas Dorrell, viz gompliments.
He do not know my name, so! But he know
ze name of ze firma I rebresent, and he vill like
to see me, I know zat, because he place large
orders, vair large, viz our gompany; he is vat
you call a gustomer, you understand.”
</p>
<p>
Timothy Ball looked doubtfully at the visitor,
and at the card he offered to him.
</p>
<p>
“There’s customers, and rum customers,” he
said.
</p>
<p>
“Rum!” interrupted the stranger. “If Mr.
Dorrell like rum, we can subbly any quantity,
in cask or bottle, at rock-bottom price.”
</p>
<p>
Timothy sniggered and rubbed his mouth
with the back of his hand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
</p>
<p>
“Rum ain’t the word for it,” he said. “’Tis
downright bloomin’ funny, that’s what it is.
Well, guv’nor, hold hard a bit; I’ll just ’phone
through to Mr. Dorrell and tell him you’re
here. <em>’Ow</em> do you say your name?”
</p>
<p>
“Schwab! Hildebrand Schwab, rebresentative
of ze Schlagintwert Gombany of Düsseldorf.”
</p>
<p>
“Can’t say all that; telephone won’t stand
it. Wait a bit while I try Swob.”
</p>
<p>
He rang up and put his ear to the receiver.
</p>
<p>
“Are you there? That you, Mr. Dorrell?...
There’s a man here ... a man ... a
gentleman to see you, name Swib ... Swob!
So he <em>said</em>, sir.... Travels for rum, by what I
can make out——”
</p>
<p>
“No! no!” cried Schwab; but Timothy
glared him into silence.
</p>
<p>
“Said you wouldn’t know him, sir, but you’re
a customer of his firm.... No, sir, <em>not</em> rum....
Can’t say it, sir.... Very well, sir
(glancing at the card): S C H L A G I N T W....
You’ve got it, sir.... He didn’t say,
sir.... Very well, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Dorrell wants to know what you’ve
come for.”
</p>
<p>
“Vill you be so kind as permit me to speak
to him myself?”
</p>
<p>
“No; your trotter might run away....
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
Yes, sir, one minute.... Now, out with it,
Mr. Swob; Mr. Dorrell’s busy.”
</p>
<p>
“Zen tell him I come from Düsseldorf on
behalf of my firma to pay zeir respects and gompliments
to zeir valued gustomer and to zay
zat ve shall be alvays most pleased to subbly
anyzink vatefer zat Mr. Dorrell vants in quickest
possible tempo egzept our Number Six Photographic
Sensitizer vich require fortnight
notice——”
</p>
<p>
“Arf a mo!... Yes, sir, but there’s such
a lot of it I can’t get hold of it all.... No,
sir, not walk; the gentleman’s rather lame, sir;
came in a pony cart.... Very well, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Dorrell says he’ll be here in a few
minutes if you’ll wait.”
</p>
<p>
“Vy certainly. I can get no train for two
hour. I vait in ze house?”
</p>
<p>
“No, Mr. Dorrell ain’t in the house. He’ll
come here. We always interview rum customers
at the gate.”
</p>
<p>
“No, no, no; not rum, my friend; and
Mr. Dorrell is ze gustomer. He buy of <em>us</em>;
at least, he order; Mr. Greatorex pay.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, it don’t matter to you, I s’pose, so
long as you get your money? Mr. Greatorex’s
money is good enough for me, anyway. Paid
for that topping cigar of yours, didn’t it?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
</p>
<p>
“I have not ze honour to know Mr. Greatorex;
but I have here a price list of cigars, and if——”
</p>
<p>
“Here’s Mr. Dorrell.”
</p>
<p>
“Vere? I see him not.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, he’s big enough, though he ain’t as
broad as he’s long: that gentleman in the blue
clothes comin’ down the path.”
</p>
<p>
“Zat Mr. Dorrell! Vy—he is a boy!
Himmel!”
</p>
<p>
“Rum, ain’t it? S’pose you never <em>was</em> a boy,
Mr. Swob.”
</p>
<p>
A tall loose-limbed young fellow had come
into the drive from a side path, and was walking
with great strides towards the gate. He was
bareheaded; his black hair tumbled over a brow
unusually high and broad. No other feature
was noticeable except his eyes, which were large,
deep blue in colour, and shot with a strange glow.
He was dressed in a loose suit of what appeared
to be blue alpaca, which was plentifully bestained.
</p>
<p>
By this time Timothy had opened the gate
and given admittance to the visitor. Tom
Dorrell came up, held out his hand, and said in
quick decisive tones—
</p>
<p>
“How d’you do, Mr.——?”
</p>
<p>
“Schwab, sir—Hildebrand Schwab, rebresentative
of ze firma Schlagintwert, all orders
punctually eggzecuted.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
</p>
<p>
“Sorry to keep you waiting. Very busy, you
know; if you had given me notice——”
</p>
<p>
“Ach! I come on ze hop, sir.”
</p>
<p>
Tom smiled.
</p>
<p>
“Well, glad to see you, anyway. Is there
anything I can do for you?”
</p>
<p>
“Sir, zat is vat I ask you. You give orders,
first class, for our Photographic Sensitizer Preparation
Number Six; but my firma zink you
do not know, perhaps, zat zey do many ozer zinks
beside Photographic Sensitizer Preparation Number
Six. Vy, zere is nozink vat ve do not do,
nozink at all. Ve can supply anyzink—soft
goots, musical boxes, hair oil——”
</p>
<p>
“I know, I know,” said Tom. “I have your
price list.”
</p>
<p>
“But not ze new vun—revise and correck
carte,” returned Schwab, pulling from his pocket
a bulky volume in red paper cover. “Viz
gompliments!”
</p>
<p>
“Thanks! Now, I am very busy——”
</p>
<p>
“Shust so! Business are business! Not for
ze vorld vould I stand in ze light. Only bermit
me shust vun vord. Ze orders you give for
Photographic Sensitizer Preparation Number Six,
vy, zey are immense, colossal; and you pay on
ze nail. My firma get no such orders novere,
and zey are surprise, because Number Six is new
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
zink; it is not long zat it is on ze market. Vy
zen come so large orders from so little place?
Zey zink zere are business to be done; zerefore
am I here.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you can’t expect the merits of the
stuff to be known all at once.”
</p>
<p>
“Shust so. Zerefore I come! Schlagintwert
say: ‘Mr. Dorrell use a great lot of P.S.P.
No. 6; zerefore muss it be vair goot; go and see
Mr. Dorrell; perhaps he be so kind to give testimonial—zat
vill be goot business.’”
</p>
<p>
“Afraid I can’t do that. You see, I don’t
use it in photography, and that is what you
advertise it for.”
</p>
<p>
“But ve vill advertise it for anyzink you
please!”
</p>
<p>
“My use of it is secret at present.”
</p>
<p>
“Zen ve vill buy ze secret! Ve are vair rich
firma.”
</p>
<p>
“But it wouldn’t be a secret then.”
</p>
<p>
“Zat is true, but it vould be business. Zere
vill be patent rights, perhaps; vell, ve buy zem;
ve buy anyzink zat is goot business.”
</p>
<p>
“No, I haven’t taken out a patent. It is very
good of you, Mr. Schwab, if at any time——”
</p>
<p>
“Ach! Vat you call any time!—zat is no
time. Now, now is ze time. I am in zis country
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
only few days. I go soon to Morocco for business.
I suffer egstremely from sea-illness, but for
business I go anyvere. Zink how it vould console
me in ze Bay of Biscay to know zat I had done
goot business for Schlagintwert—and for you,
Mr. Dorrell.”
</p>
<p>
“Sorry. Really I can’t say any more, Mr.
Schwab. I <em>must</em> go; look me up again, if you
like, when you get back from Morocco.”
</p>
<p>
Recognizing that Tom was not to be drawn,
the German swallowed his disappointment, took
leave in most expansive terms, and was soon jogging
back in the direction from which he had come.
But finding, on arriving at the station, that he
had an hour to wait for his train, he introduced
himself to the station-master and tactfully led
the conversation to Midfont House and its owner,
Mr. Greatorex. What he learnt in the course
of it was something to the following effect.
</p>
<p>
Some years before, Mr. Greatorex had discovered
a taste for mechanics in the son of the
village smith at Barton Abbas, twenty miles
away. He had put the boy to a good school,
often had him at Midfont House in the holidays,
and paid his fees at the university in the neighbouring
town, where the boy took honours in
mechanics and engineering at a very early age.
Then, about a year before this time, Mr. Greatorex
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
had fenced in a large piece of waste ground
on his estate, erected a workshop in the middle
of it, and given it up entirely to young Dorrell,
who was now apparently a permanent inmate
of his house. What went on in the workshop
the station-master did not know. The enclosure
was kept strictly private; nobody outside the
family was ever allowed to pass its borders. The
station-master believed that young Dorrell was
inventing a motor-car; it was said that Mr.
Greatorex’s interest in him dated from the day
when the boy had repaired some trifling mishap
which had befallen his car on the road.
</p>
<p>
The effect of this information on Herr Schwab
was greater than the station-master ever knew.
When the train came in, the German got into
it; but he alighted at the next station two miles
off, and trudged back over the road until he once
more stood at the gate of Midfont House. It
was now dark. Schwab did not this time pull
the bell. He walked on past the gate for a good
quarter of a mile, then halted at a large heap of
stones collected for mending the road.
</p>
<p>
There were no wayfarers at this late hour;
nobody saw how this big figure in the frock-coat
employed himself. He filled his glossy hat with
flints from the heap, carried it to the foot of the
fence, and emptied it there, returning for another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
hatful. After an hour’s patient work a pile
of stones stood some three feet high against the
fence. Mopping his damp brow, dusting the
inside of his hat, and replacing it on his head,
Schwab mounted the pile, clambered over the
fence, and dropped down somewhat heavily on
the other side. Not till that moment had he
given a thought to the means of getting back;
and looking up at the fence, the top of which
was quite beyond his reach, he uttered a low
guttural exclamation of dismay. But the die
was cast! Consumed by his curiosity to learn
more about this mysterious workshop, in the
way of business, he had come thus far, and as
there was apparently no going back he decided
to make his way forward.
</p>
<p>
He found himself in an extensive meadow,
bordered by trees. No habitation was in sight.
The moon threw a little light on the scene, and,
after walking for some minutes over the grass, he
perceived a long low oblong building which, as
he drew nearer, he saw was built of wood, with
no windows in the walls, but having fanlights in
the sloping roof. There was but one door.
</p>
<p>
“Ich hoffe dass die Thur nicht verriegelt
ist!” he muttered as, glancing apprehensively
round, he approached to try the handle. He
was not conscious of anything improper in this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
nocturnal enterprise: was it not all in the way
of business?
</p>
<p>
He came to the door, and grasped the
handle....
</p>
<p>
When he recovered consciousness he found
himself on his back on the grass. In his right
hand there was a feeling as if it had been burnt
to the bone. With many sighs and groans he
rose, sought for his hat, and, turning his back
on the workshop, limped sadly towards the fence.
His whole body tingled with the electric shock.
Bitterly he lamented his unhappy zeal for business.
What an abominable device for protecting the
premises! And there was that terrible fence
to be climbed, or he would have to remain all
night in the field, assuredly to be discovered in
the morning and suspected of felonious intent.
He remembered that Timothy Ball had spoken
of his master as a magistrate, and saw himself
already, frock-coat, silk hat and all, in a felon’s
cell.
</p>
<p>
Shaken to the core he came to the fence, and
spent a weary hour in groping up and down,
trying to find an outlet. At length, when he
had almost given up hope, and was trying to
steel his soul against the exposure of the morrow,
he reached a tree whose branches overhung the
fence. It was more than thirty years since, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
a boy, he had climbed a tree in sport; who could
have foreseen that now, a man of bulk, he would
be forced to attempt the feat in the interests
of business? And his right hand was so desperately
painful! Luckily the trunk was gnarled
and a branch hung low. He tried to heave
himself up, and his hat fell off. He picked it up
and shied it impatiently over the fence. Then
he tried again, and felt in the extremity of despair
when he heard the <em>oosh</em> of tearing silk. Alas!
for his new frock-coat! But he was at least
safely on the bough. He worked himself along
it, dreading lest it should snap, and conscious
of the inconvenience of fourteen stone. Happily
he was now on the right side of the fence. He
dropped, and alighted in a bed of nettles. He
got up, found his hat, mechanically brushed it
with his sleeve, and set it on his head.
</p>
<p>
“Ach! Ich unglücklicher!” he sighed as he
set off up the road.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>CHAPTER III—TOM MAKES EXPERIMENTS</h2>
<p>
The information given to Herr Schwab by
the Midfont station-master was accurate
up to a certain point. Mr. Greatorex had
indeed constituted himself the beneficent patron
of Tom Dorrell, educated him, entertained him
at Midfont House, and built for him a workshop
in the grounds. So far the station-master was
right. But when he added that Tom was working
at a new motor-car, he stated a hypothesis,
not a fact.
</p>
<p>
About a year before this time, when Tom
came to Midfont House to spend a month’s holiday,
he brought with him a small model of an
aerial machine on which he had been quietly
working in leisure moments. He showed it to
Mr. Greatorex.
</p>
<p>
“Very pretty,” said the worthy merchant,
examining the toy; “but it won’t <em>go</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh yes it will,” said Tom. “See!”
</p>
<p>
They were in Mr. Greatorex’s study at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
time. Tom poised the model on his left hand,
released a spring, and the little aeroplane, with
a whizz and a hum, soared across the room, and,
before it could be stopped, dashed against the
glass door of a bookcase and shivered it to
atoms.
</p>
<p>
“I’m awfully sorry,” said Tom contritely,
picking up the machine and silencing it.
</p>
<p>
“What <em>are</em> you doing, John?” said Mrs.
Greatorex, opening the door. “What a terrible
mess!” she added, surveying the litter on the
floor.
</p>
<p>
“It shall be swept up, my dear,” said Mr.
Greatorex. “You can’t make omelets without
breaking <em>eggs</em>, my love.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Greatorex looked a little puzzled.
</p>
<p>
“Of course not, my dear,” she said after a
moment. Then with a deprecating smile she
went away. Mr. Greatorex locked the door.
</p>
<p>
“Now, Tom,” he said, “just <em>explain</em>, will
you? Begin at the beginning; I want to <em>know</em>,
you know.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’ve been thinking a lot at odd times
about airships and things, and reading up what
they’ve been doing in France and Germany.
There’s little prospect of making a really serviceable
machine out of the old gas balloon; it’s
far too clumsy; can’t make headway against a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
strong wind; but I didn’t see why something
shouldn’t be done on the lines of the aeroplane.
You see, it’s easy enough to set the thing going,
and even to steer it, when you’ve got it up in the
air; but there are three difficulties: to get it
up, to let it down without smashing it to bits,
and to keep it from turning somersaults. You
can overcome the force of gravity by an arrangement
of planes when you keep up a good speed;
but if you slacken speed, down you come. And
all the aeroplanes that have been invented yet
can’t rise in the air at any given spot. They
either have to be thrown off from some elevated
position, or they have to get up a momentum
along the ground, running like a motor-car.
Then again, the motor machinery has been too
heavy; engines haven’t been able to exert
sufficient horse-power in proportion to their own
weight. I’ve worked it out, and I calculate
that no good can be done till you get an engine
that’ll give you one horse-power to every two
and a half pounds of its weight.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Well?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, this model is the result of no end of
experiments. It goes, as you see; but besides
sailing horizontally, it will lift itself. Look!”
</p>
<p>
He took up the little machine, released another
spring, and the miniature airship went flying to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
the ceiling, where it remained until the spring
ran down.
</p>
<p>
“All very well,” said Mr. Greatorex, unwilling
to admit that he was impressed; “but the thing
is only a <em>toy</em>. There’s all the difference in the
world between a model and the <em>real thing</em>, you
know. You could never get a spring strong
enough to lift a real machine. I’m not satisfied
that you could even get the horizontal motion
you’re so cocksure of, with a machine that would
carry <em>men</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“No spring would do it, it is true; but I’ve
worked out an application of the principle. It’s
well known that a propeller rotating at sufficient
speed can be made to lift a weight into the air. Of
course we couldn’t set a real airship rotating bodily;
no aeronaut’s head would stand it if we could.
But, as you saw, my model doesn’t rotate itself.
I’ve only made use of the principle—pretty
successfully, don’t you think?”
</p>
<p>
“Just explain to me <em>thoroughly</em>, will you? I
want a little more <em>light</em> on the subject.”
</p>
<p>
Tom took his model, and patiently expounded
the mechanical principles on which he had worked.
The upshot of this and other conversations was
that Mr. Greatorex became first interested, then
enthusiastic, and finally determined. He had a
workshop erected on a large piece of waste ground
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
nearly a mile and a half square on his estate, and
gave Tom carte blanche to get what assistance
and spend what money he pleased. Resolving
to keep the matter a close secret until the experiments
were concluded, he fenced in the enclosure,
and gave strict orders that no one was to be
admitted to it without Tom’s consent. Tom
himself devised a simple means of defending the
workshop from prying visitors. Whenever he
left it, he set going a strong electric current
through the door handle, which was a more
effective protection than locks and bolts.
</p>
<p>
Tom found, as soon as he came to enlarge his
model into a practical working size, that none of
the motors then on the market was sufficiently
powerful in proportion to its weight to give him
the necessary lifting force. The electric motor
was out of the question, and an adaptation of the
latest petrol engine as applied to motor-cars and
launches seemed to offer the most likely solution.
Even here, however, the march of invention had
not gone far enough. The latest petrol motor,
it is true, enabled Tom to keep the machine at a
constant altitude when once it was in flight;
but it failed to raise it from a position of rest.
Some other method must be found, and he set
his wits to work to discover it.
</p>
<p>
The first condition of success was, he felt, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
discovery of an explosive mixture far more powerful
than that offered by petrol, and yet capable
of being harnessed and controlled. He had the
run of Mr. Greatorex’s chemical laboratories,
and the benefit of the practical advice and assistance
of the heads of the experimental staff.
Scores of preparations were tried, and, for one
reason or another, rejected. Where sufficient
power was obtained, it was almost invariably
found that the mixture was not stable or uniform
in its effects. Several explosive mixtures were
discovered quite powerful enough for the purpose;
but, as Mr. Greatorex’s chief chemist
pointed out, all of them were likely to blow the
airship to smithereens in the event of any accident
to the machinery.
</p>
<p>
It was some months after the beginning of
the experiments when one of the junior chemists
came to Tom with the announcement that he
had discovered what he thought might be
the very substance required. A German firm,
Schlagintwert &amp; Co. of Düsseldorf, had placed
on the market a few months earlier a powder
which, used as a solution, was highly valuable in
preparing photographic plates. The exact ingredients
of the powder were unknown, although
by analysis it had been found to consist of nitrate
compounds; but the buyer was warned by a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
label that it should not be exposed to great heat
owing to the danger of explosion. It had occurred
to the chemist to mix a little of this powder with
petrol. The result was a paste which dried hard,
but gave off almost infinitesimal particles of a
highly explosive nature, when floating in an air
chamber, though the paste itself was not explosive
either under heat or shock.
</p>
<p>
Tom was delighted with the discovery, and
at once proceeded to construct an engine suitable
to the peculiar properties of the composition.
In building the motor he adapted the principle
of the turbine to airship navigation. A powerful
fan drove the current of air through a number
of perforated aluminium plates covered with the
paste. The resultant mixture of air and explosive
particles passed into the explosion chamber, the
intake being controlled by automatic valves
connected with the turbine. The explosion of
the mixture was brought about by a sparking
plug connected with a small electric battery, the
sparking being controlled by a cam on the shaft.
At each explosion, the gas generated was forced
at an enormous pressure through the turbine to
the right of the explosion chamber, thus driving
the propeller fixed on the shaft.
</p>
<p>
Tom made his fan serve a double purpose, not
only to drive air through the aluminium plates,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
but to send a current round a jacket on the outside
of the turbine and thus keep the latter cool.
This was a highly necessary arrangement owing
to the enormous heat generated. From the first,
indeed, the difficulty of cooling the turbine was
the most serious with which he had to grapple.
It required months of experiment before the
engine could be worked for more than two or three
minutes at a time. Gradually, however, by
increasing the power of the fan, and constructing
the turbine casing and blades of an alloy specially
adapted to resist the effects of intense heat, this
difficulty was to a great extent overcome.
</p>
<p>
The airship when completed was not unlike
a huge bird with wings outstretched. The body
of the bird consisted of the car and engine. The
wings were planes of lath strengthened with
aluminium, and capable of being inclined at any
desired angle by the simple movement of a
switch in the car. A large rectangular plane
projecting from the rear of the car acted as a
rudder, principally for lateral movement, motion
upwards and downwards being provided for either
by the inclination of the larger planes or by the
special screws actuated by the engine. The latter
drove two sets of propellers: one fore and aft,
giving a horizontal movement, the other below
and above the car, giving a vertical movement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
Either set of propellers could be thrown out of
gear when desired. Tom would have been glad
to dispense with the vertical propellers if he
could have done so, but he found that the whole
force of his engine was necessary to raise the
airship from a position of rest. He had not
sufficient motive power to enable him to use
such an adjustment of oblique propellers as would
have ensured simultaneous horizontal and vertical
movement.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Greatorex at once promoted the fortunate
young chemist who had discovered the virtues
of the Schlagintwert powder, and swore him
to secrecy. The parts of Tom’s machine were
made to his order by various firms, the work
being distributed so that no one firm should be
in possession of the complete apparatus; and a
few weeks before Herr Schwab’s visit, an aeroplane
capable of sustaining the weight of several men
was finished, and in it Tom made daily trips about
the field. He tested it so frequently that he
used considerable quantities of the powder, and
it was not surprising that the curiosity of Schlagintwerts
was aroused by the large orders that
came from one small place for an article that
cost a good deal more than its weight in gold.
</p>
<p>
Tom was, however, not yet satisfied with his
machine. For one thing he had found it impossible as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
yet to return to earth with any exactitude
at a fixed spot. It was a matter of the nice
adjustment of the horizontal with the vertical
motion, and after repeated failures Tom comforted
himself with the thought that it must be
only after long practice that an engine driver
could pull his locomotive up to a nicety. Obviously
much more practice must be required
when the task was infinitely more difficult.
</p>
<p>
Further, in spite of the jacket around the
turbine, the heat generated was still too great
to allow of travelling any great distance in safety,
and the prospective usefulness of the aeroplane
was discounted accordingly.
</p>
<p>
It was Mr. Greatorex who suggested a possible
way out of the difficulty.
</p>
<p>
“Why not have two engines instead of one?”
he said. “If one breaks down—why, there’s
the other.”
</p>
<p>
“It means more weight,” said Tom ruefully,
“and therefore less speed and less carrying
capacity.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, there’s no <em>hurry</em>, is there? And as for
carrying capacity—<em>I</em> don’t intend to tempt the
fates, or run the risk of a smash-up like—who
was it? Icarus? Thought so.”
</p>
<p>
Tom adopted the suggestion. He replaced
his first engine by two somewhat smaller, so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
that if one became overheated there was the
other in reserve. The lifting capacity and
the speed of the airship were consequently
diminished, but scarcely so much as Tom expected.
</p>
<p>
So far the experiments had been carried on
with perfect secrecy. The enclosure was surrounded
by trees, and Tom was always careful
not to drive his machine above the level of their
tops. But one day, a few months after Schwab’s
visit, he was careering round, to the mingled
admiration and terror of Timothy Ball watching
him from the ground, when he was startled by
an exclamation that certainly did not spring
from the lips of that worthy. Timothy was a
good quarter-mile away; the voice appeared to
come from a spot almost vertically below the
aeroplane.
</p>
<p>
“By George! Look there, Mops!”
</p>
<p>
Tom took a hurried peep over. There, below
him, in a gap between the trees just beyond the
inner fence, stood a tall young fellow in tennis
flannels, with light blue cap and tie.
</p>
<p>
“What is it, Pops?” answered a silvery voice;
and a second figure joined the first—a girl in
white.
</p>
<p>
“Why, look! Hanged if it isn’t an aeroplane,
going like one o’clock, too.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, how dreadful!” cried the girl, looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
up. “I am sure it will fall, and there will be a
horrid accident. Oh, do come away, Raymond!”
</p>
<p>
“Not I! This is hot stuff, Mopsy. By
Jove, the fellow can steer the thing. He’s making
for that shanty over there—and coming down
like a lark. I say, Mops, give me a leg-up; I
want to have a nearer squint at the machine.”
</p>
<p>
“But, Raymond, it’s no business of yours—it’s—it’s
trespassing!”
</p>
<p>
“Trespassing be hanged! We’re next-door
neighbours. Come, give me a shove up.”
</p>
<p>
He clutched the top of the fence; his sister,
still feebly expostulating, gave him a most workmanlike
hoist, and in a few seconds he disappeared
on the other side. The girl waited a
little; then turned and walked away.
</p>
<p>
Her brother meanwhile was hastening across
the field towards the workshop, near which the
aeroplane had by this time alighted. Halfway
he was met by Timothy Ball, who touched his
cap and said—
</p>
<p>
“Beg pardon, sir, but these are private grounds
and you’re a trespasser.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s all right. My name’s Oliphant;
we’re neighbours of yours, you know.”
</p>
<p>
“Now, that’s a good un. Hold hard, sir”—as
the intruder made to walk round him—“my
orders is to allow no one on the premises! Your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
name’s Oliphant, you said? Well, you can’t
be a neighbour, ’cos the only neighbour I knows
of is Lord Langside.”
</p>
<p>
“He’s my father.”
</p>
<p>
“But—Oliphant——”
</p>
<p>
“Exactly! Now, come along, my good fellow—I
want to see your master.”
</p>
<p>
“He don’t want to see you, though. No you
don’t; keep off, sir; my orders is to allow no
one on the premises.”
</p>
<p>
Then began a little game of dodging, Timothy
stepping in front of the intruder and stretching
his arms like a cattle driver. In half a minute
Raymond Oliphant gave it up.
</p>
<p>
“Really, this is too absurd,” he said good-temperedly.
“I say, I’ll give you my word to
stay here while you go and tell your master that
I’d like to introduce myself to him.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you’ll stay a long time, ‘cos master’s
in town and won’t be home till seven o’clock.”
</p>
<p>
“Well then, the driver of that aeroplane,
whoever he is. Ah! here he comes, thank
goodness!”
</p>
<p>
Tom was hastening across the field. He wore
his usual working suit of blue alpaca; face and
hands were much begrimed.
</p>
<p>
“Your watch-dog here won’t let me pass,”
said Oliphant with a smile as Tom came up.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
“I told him I was a neighbour, but he thinks I’m
a bad lot. We’ve only just come to the place;
my father has taken it, you know; he’s coming
down for shooting as soon as Parliament’s up.
I saw your aeroplane skylarking round, and
couldn’t resist the temptation to come over for
a nearer look. You don’t mind?”
</p>
<p>
“Well—no.” Tom’s tone was dubious.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, if you’d rather not, of course!”
</p>
<p>
“No, I don’t mind really. But Mr. Greatorex
is rather particular about keeping the matter
quiet——”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be mum as the dead, I assure you. I
don’t know anything about machinery; it isn’t
in our line at Eton; you needn’t be afraid of
my giving the secret away.”
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t that, exactly. I’m not afraid of
your discovering the secret of the machine;
but it’s rather important that the fact of its
existence shouldn’t leak out just yet.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you’ll have to make friends with my
sister then. She has seen it too. It’s lucky
Mother is in town, or the secret would be out
by this time.”
</p>
<p>
They were walking now side by side to the shed.
</p>
<p>
“You’re not Mr. Greatorex’s son, then?”
</p>
<p>
“No; my name’s Dorrell. I’m no relation
of his.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
</p>
<p>
“My name’s Raymond Oliphant. I’m just
home from Eton; long holidays, you know.
That’s a clinking machine of yours. Never
seen anything like it before. Did Mr. Greatorex
invent it? I understood he was a chemical
manufacturer.”
</p>
<p>
“No. I did.”
</p>
<p>
“Really! I say—d’you mind?—how old are
you?”
</p>
<p>
“Eighteen.”
</p>
<p>
“Just my age! And I’m rotting about at
Eton while you——I say, you ought to make
a good thing of this.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s only experimental at present. We
haven’t tried a long flight.”
</p>
<p>
“Will you get the Government to take it up?
I’ll put in a word with the pater, you know.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s altogether premature,” said Tom
with a smile.
</p>
<p>
“Why, it seemed to me to go all right. Will
it take two?”
</p>
<p>
“Two of our weight, I think. Would you
like to try?”
</p>
<p>
“Rather! And I say, just keep out of sight
from our grounds, will you? If Margaret were
to catch sight of me she’d have a fit or something.
By Jove! it won’t be so slow here as I feared.”
</p>
<p>
Oliphant spent a quarter of an hour in the air,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
and when he descended was overflowing with
enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>
“It’s simply ripping, Mr. Dorrell,” he cried.
“I may come again, mayn’t I?”
</p>
<p>
“Certainly,” said Tom, adding with a smile:
“On one condition.”
</p>
<p>
“Trust me, I won’t say a word. And I’ll
shut Margaret’s mouth too—if I can. Look
here, it seems to me you’d be the best man for
that job. I’ll bring Margaret to-morrow—may
I?—and when she knows you’re the inventor,
and you impress on her that your life’s at stake
or something, she’ll be more likely to hold her
tongue than if <em>I</em> jaw. Good-bye.”
</p>
<p>
Tom thought it necessary to inform Mr.
Greatorex, in the drawing-room before dinner,
of what had happened.
</p>
<p>
“Hm!” he grunted. “Eton boy, is he?
Got any <em>sense</em>?”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t examine him,” said Tom with a
laugh. “I thought him quite a decent fellow.
He was very good-tempered with Tim, who was
a trifle taken aback when he learnt that he had
ordered off the son of the Prime Minister.”
</p>
<p>
“And a precious Prime Minister he <em>is</em>! Mark
my words, Tom, the Country’s going to the dogs.
To the <em>dogs</em>! We’re dropping <em>behind</em>, Tom,
and Langside hasn’t the grit to prevent it.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Oliphant suggested that a word to his
father might induce him to buy the aeroplane
for the Country.”
</p>
<p>
“God bless my soul, you mustn’t <em>dream</em> of
it! Langside will be turned out at the next
election; John Brooks will go in, and he’s the
man to steer this old country through. No, no!
and if young Oliphant blabs a word of it to his
father, I’ll—I’ll——Yes, my love”—as Mrs. Greatorex
entered—“we were talking about our
new neighbour, Lord Langside. It appears that
his son and daughter have come down.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, John, do you think I should call?”
</p>
<p>
“On <em>no account</em>, my dear. I <em>hate</em> Langside’s
politics, and we’ll <em>have nothing to do with them</em>.
Now, Tom, give Mrs. Greatorex your arm.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV—A PRISONER IN ZEMMUR</h2>
<p>
A few mornings after the meeting with
Raymond Oliphant, Tom, coming down
to breakfast, found Mr. Greatorex in a state of
high excitability, with the <em>Times</em> outspread before
him.
</p>
<p>
“What did I say, Tom!” he shouted. “Didn’t
I <em>tell</em> you the Country was going to the dogs!
What do you think of <em>this</em>, now?”
</p>
<p>
He read out a short paragraph—
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“Information has just reached the Foreign Office
that Sir Mark Ingleton, who recently left London on a
diplomatic mission to Morocco, has been captured by
tribesmen and carried off to the hills. Strong pressure
is being brought to bear on the Sultan to take steps
against the offenders; but if, as is feared, Sir Mark
Ingleton’s captor is the notorious rebel whose headquarters
are at Zemmur, there is little hope of the Sultan
in his present state of impotence being able to make
his authority felt.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s what has happened to a servant of
the British Crown under Langside’s administration;”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
said Mr. Greatorex hotly. “Strong
<em>pressure</em>, indeed! It wants a fleet, an expedition,
a few quick-firers and Long Toms.”
</p>
<p>
“But wouldn’t that make a blaze?” said
Tom quietly. “In the present state of affairs
it might give rise to no end of complications in
Europe, too.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t tell <em>me</em>!” cried Mr. Greatorex, banging
his fist on the paper. “We’re sinking into
a state of jelly-fish; any one can poke us and
smack us and we simply <em>go in</em>. This’ll smash
the Government: that’s one good thing; and
we’ll see what John Brooks can do when <em>he’s</em> at
the helm.”
</p>
<p>
Later in the day Raymond Oliphant, who
was now a privileged visitor to the shed, adverted
to the subject.
</p>
<p>
“Thank your stars you are not Prime Minister,
Dorrell,” he said. “The pater came down for
the week-end, and he’s nearly off his chump,
poor old chap! He knew about this kidnapping
three days ago, before it got into the papers,
and he went back to town this morning prepared
for squalls in the House.”
</p>
<p>
“Can’t he do anything?”
</p>
<p>
“He says not. One of the Opposition rags
was screaming about an expedition on Saturday,
but of course that can’t be risked. And it might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
fail after all—just as the Gordon expedition did.
That Moorish brigand might kill Ingleton if
hard pressed.”
</p>
<p>
“But what would he gain by that? He’s
playing for a ransom, I suppose.”
</p>
<p>
“No, there’s more in it than that. We’ve
already offered an enormous ransom through the
Sultan; but the rebel wants to get certain
concessions out of the Sultan, and thinks he’ll
manage it by getting the Sultan into hot water
with us. I say, what a pity your aeroplane isn’t
fit for the job. What a grand idea it would be
to snap up the prisoner under the very noses of
his captors! I suppose it <em>isn’t</em> up to it, eh?”
</p>
<p>
Tom shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“I couldn’t trust it to go so far. You see,
here the workshop is at hand, and if anything
goes wrong it can be easily repaired. It would
be rather a poor lookout if the thing came to
grief in the Bay of Biscay, say, and I came souse
into the sea.”
</p>
<p>
“It <em>would</em> be rather rotten. Well, let’s have
a spin now.”
</p>
<p>
The two mounted the car, and spent an hour
in wheeling about the enclosure. Tom ventured
to set the motors at a higher speed than he had
before tried, and put the aeroplane through a
score of evolutions, which demonstrated that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
had it perfectly under control. Oliphant in his
enthusiasm returned again to the matter of the
captured envoy.
</p>
<p>
“I say, is it quite out of the question, d’you
think?”
</p>
<p>
“Afraid so. Perhaps in a few months——”
</p>
<p>
“That’s no good,” interrupted his companion.
“The occasion will be passed. Ingleton will be
either released or dead, and, in any case, there’ll
be such a terrific agitation against the pater
that he’ll be forced to resign. He wouldn’t mind
personally; but there’s the Country, you see.
Can’t you risk it?”
</p>
<p>
“I might if only myself were concerned; but
there’s Mr. Greatorex to reckon with. The
whole thing’s only experimental. I’m sure he
wouldn’t hear of it.”
</p>
<p>
“Politics is a rotten game! Wish we were
back in the times before Whigs and Tories were
invented.”
</p>
<p>
“And unpopular ministers lost their heads!—Now
I’m going to let her down. See how near
she falls to the perpendicular.”
</p>
<p>
He dropped a hammer out of the car, stopped
the horizontal motion and started the vertical,
adjusted the planes, and descended gently to the
ground.
</p>
<p>
“That’s better,” he cried, when he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
measured the distance between the aeroplane and
the hammer; “it’s only a dozen yards. We’re
getting on. Really, I wish I could try your
suggestion.”
</p>
<p>
“Shall I mention it to the pater?” said
Oliphant eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Not on any account,” said Tom aghast.
“Even if I could do it, he of all men must not
know.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t see why.”
</p>
<p>
“Supposing I tried it and came a cropper,
there’d be a double outcry against him; the
first for not rescuing Sir Mark Ingleton, the
second for allowing a crack-brained engineer to
make a fool of himself and a corpse in the bargain.
No, give it up; I don’t see any help for it.”
</p>
<p>
But when left to himself Tom could not keep
his thoughts from Oliphant’s suggestion. The
adventurous idea captivated his imagination;
he began to consider it in earnest; he spent
several hours of the afternoon in further experimenting
with the aeroplane, and after dinner,
when Mr. Greatorex and he went out into the
grounds for their customary stroll and cigarettes,
he broached the subject, in a casual way, and in
much the same terms as Oliphant had used.
</p>
<p>
“Pity we couldn’t take a trip to Morocco
and get Ingleton away,” he said cautiously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
</p>
<p>
“Eh! Pull Langside’s chestnuts out of the
fire! He was a fool to send the man to Morocco.
I wouldn’t if I could, and of <em>course</em> it’s impossible.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not sure of that. And it isn’t a party
matter, really.”
</p>
<p>
“Not party! It’s <em>all</em> party.”
</p>
<p>
“Sir Mark Ingleton is an agent of the Crown,
sir, and the Crown is above party. I think in
these matters we might sink our differences.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, and sink our aeroplane, and <em>drown</em>
ourselves, and serve us <em>right</em>.”
</p>
<p>
But opposition was only a stimulus to Tom.
He began to argue the matter strenuously. Mr.
Greatorex, to do him justice, was no bigot. His
politics were at bottom a particularly intense
form of patriotism; and when Tom showed
him that there were at any rate possibilities in
the suggestion, he gradually changed his view,
forgot his reluctance to help a political opponent,
and became indeed quite enthusiastic.
</p>
<p>
“By <em>George</em>, Tom!” he exclaimed; “what
a grand send-off it would be to your invention
if the first use of it were the rescue of this unfortunate
diplomatist! And what a magnificent
thing for the Country! Come and let’s talk it
out over a cup of coffee. Not a <em>word</em> before
Mrs. Greatorex, mind.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, John, are you pleased with your toy?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
said that good lady when they re-entered the
house.
</p>
<p>
“Quite, my dear, <em>quite</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“It will be quite a feature of our garden party.
But I hope Tom will make sure that it is absolutely
safe before he takes anybody up at half a
crown a ride. I shall be glad of the half-crowns
for my Nursing Association, but I should never
forgive you if any one was hurt.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, my dear, the half-crowns would go to
pay the <em>nurses</em>.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Greatorex and Tom had a long talk in
the study that night. Up to the present the
longest journey the aeroplane had taken without
descending was, as Tom estimated, about forty
miles. Then something had always occurred
to make a descent necessary. The principal
stumbling-block had been the overheating of
the motors. But Tom suggested that if he were
content with a speed of about twenty-five miles
an hour, a greater distance might be covered
without this risk.
</p>
<p>
The practical question was, could the machine
be brought so near the place of the envoy’s
captivity as to make a dash upon it practicable?
From the latest report, in the evening paper, it
appeared that the prisoner was held in a mountain
fastness some eighty miles from the Atlantic seaboard.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
Tom got out a map and pointed out
the spot. It did not seem impossible to reach
it by means of the airship from some convenient
place on the coast.
</p>
<p>
“D’you know what occurs to me?” said Tom.
“You were talking of a yachting cruise in the
<em>Dandy Dinmont</em> in September. Why not make
it a little earlier? I could then go in the airship
and you in the yacht; and we could make
that a kind of floating base, taking in it all
materials necessary for repairs.”
</p>
<p>
“But you couldn’t repair the thing without
letting it down on the deck.”
</p>
<p>
“I could do that, I think. To-day I came
down within a few feet of the spot I aimed at,
and I could let the machine down on deck if the
yacht were not rolling or pitching too much.”
</p>
<p>
“But <em>hang</em> it all, Tom, the deck <em>wasn’t made</em>
for such a purpose.”
</p>
<p>
“No; but it wouldn’t take long to rig up a
temporary wooden platform and framework
over the after-part of the vessel to serve as a
landing-stage.”
</p>
<p>
“You appear to have thought it all out,”
said Mr. Greatorex. “D’you want to rush me
off my <em>feet</em>?”
</p>
<p>
“Not a bit,” replied Tom smiling. “You’ll
be safe on deck.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, how long will it take to get everything
ready?”
</p>
<p>
“A week.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well. I’ll write off to Bodgers to-night
to trim the yacht. The rest I leave to you.
And mind, not a <em>word</em> to a soul.”
</p>
<p>
“I think I shall have to tell Oliphant. In
fact, it was he who put it into my head.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s a nuisance! Well, we’ll have him
to dinner to-morrow. I want to take stock of
him. Not a <em>word</em> till I have sized him up.”
</p>
<p>
Oliphant came to dinner with his sister and
was approved. Mrs. Greatorex afterwards pronounced
him to be “quite a nice boy.” Mr.
Greatorex used different terms.
</p>
<p>
“He’s no <em>fool</em>, and don’t <em>talk</em> too much,” he
said.
</p>
<p>
The three had a very animated discussion as
they walked in the cool of the evening. Mr.
Greatorex was very emphatic on the point of
secrecy.
</p>
<p>
“We don’t want any newspaper fellow to get
wind of the airship until we’ve <em>proved</em> it,” he
said. “A pretty fool I should look if they
gassed about it for a column or two and then
the whole thing went <em>pop</em> like a paper balloon.
And that Morocco fellow will have plenty of
spies, of course; <em>I</em> know their Eastern ways;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
and if he got a hint of what we’re up to, he’d be
on his guard and then there’d be fizzle.”
</p>
<p>
“How many passengers will the machine
carry?” asked Oliphant.
</p>
<p>
“Three or four light-weights, I should think,”
Tom replied.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll have room for me, then?”
</p>
<p>
“Good heavens, no!” cried Mr. Greatorex.
“Couldn’t <em>hear</em> of it!”
</p>
<p>
“But it was my idea, you know, Mr. Greatorex.
I was only longing for something to fill these
holidays.”
</p>
<p>
“Absurd! Preposterous! You’re under
age; you couldn’t go without your father’s
permission; you couldn’t ask that without giving
the whole thing away: and I couldn’t be responsible
for you.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I tell you what it is, Mr. Greatorex.
You invite me to go a cruise in your yacht. The
mater’s got a notion that my lungs are weak,
and was saying only the other day that a sea trip
would do me good. I’d see some of the fun,
then.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>There</em> you are, Mr. Oliphant! <em>Fun! I</em>
regard it as most <em>serious</em>, I assure you. Now, in
<em>my</em> young days——”
</p>
<p>
“I bet you liked fun as well as any of us, Mr.
Greatorex,” said Oliphant quickly. “If the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
truth were known, I dare say you really beat us
all.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Greatorex’s eyes twinkled.
</p>
<p>
“Well, now I come to think of it, I <em>was</em> a
wild young rip. So they all said. I remember—— But
come now, I mustn’t tell you <em>that</em>. <em>Never</em>
do! Your father would never let you go; he
doesn’t know me and doesn’t want to, and I’m
doing my level best to kick him out at the next
election.”
</p>
<p>
“And he’ll probably be jolly glad if you
succeed! Mayn’t I come, Mr. Greatorex?”
</p>
<p>
“Sorry to disoblige you, Mr. Oliphant, but
it would <em>never do</em>. No. In fact, I think we’ll
give it up altogether. Too risky! We’ll give
it <em>up</em>, Tom.”
</p>
<p>
Oliphant went home in a very bad temper.
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Greatorex is a dear old thing,” said
his sister.
</p>
<p>
“And Mr. Greatorex is an old rotter,” retorted
Raymond in a tone of disgust.
</p>
<p>
Margaret Oliphant obtained very unsatisfactory
answers to the questions to which this remark
gave rise, and concluded that in some way
Raymond had not hit it with his host.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Greatorex would doubtless have been
much surprised had he seen the letter which
Lord Langside wrote to his son a few days later.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
</p>
<p>
“<span class='sc'>My dear Ray</span>,” wrote the Prime Minister,—
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“Are you conspiring against me, like Absalom? Mr.
Greatorex can’t do me much harm on a yacht. He
won’t see a newspaper for a month! Hope you’ll
enjoy yourself.
</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-right:2em;;'>“Your affectionate</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-right:2em;;'>“<span class='sc'>Dad</span>.”</p>
<p>
Oliphant showed this letter to no one. But
the day he received it, he went a long and tedious
journey by train across country to the little
port of Horleston. He reached home very late,
but in much better spirits than might have been
expected after such a tiresome experience of
slow trains.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>CHAPTER V—OFF THE BARBARY COAST</h2>
<p>
The week was filled with the bustle of preparation.
The airship was divided into
sections, the motors and the framework taken
to pieces, and the whole packed into large light
crates and conveyed to the coast on country
carts, their arrival at Horleston being so timed
that everything could be put on board very early
in the morning. Besides the crew, the company
consisted only of Mr. Greatorex, Tom Dorrell,
and Timothy Ball.
</p>
<p>
Before the vessel put off, a custom house officer
came aboard, and showed himself somewhat
inquisitive as to the meaning of the strange platform
newly rigged on the after deck, and as to the
nature of the bulky packages. Mr. Greatorex
explained that they contained a cooling apparatus
which he was taking out to Morocco on behalf of
an acquaintance, adding that by all accounts the
country was pretty hot in all respects. With
this explanation the officer had to be content.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
Clearly the parts of the airship did not come
within the description of explosives, firearms
or other articles on which he might exercise his
powers of detention. Still, being by training
suspicious, he was evidently by no means satisfied,
and left the yacht somewhat unwillingly.
</p>
<p>
Steam was already up and the officer had barely
left the vessel before she put to sea.
</p>
<p>
“Just as well to be clear away before he gets
his second wind,” said Mr. Greatorex with a
chuckle. In his spotless white ducks and blue
cap he was enjoying himself already. “Did that
uncommonly well, didn’t I, Tom?” he said.
“What could be more useful than cooling apparatus
when there’s a chance of getting into very
hot water, eh?”
</p>
<p>
He took a run over the vessel as soon as she
had made an offing. His yacht was a hobby,
and whenever he went for a cruise he liked to
examine her in the company of his officers, with
whom, as with the crew, whom he knew
individually, he was very popular. In the
course of his inspection he came to the engine
room.
</p>
<p>
“How do, Mr. Mumford!” he said genially
to the engineer. “All in good order, eh?”
</p>
<p>
“Tip-top, sir. This is the neatest bit of
machinery I’ve ever had to do with.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
</p>
<p>
“Glad to hear that. I <em>say</em>, is that a new stoker
I see there? What’s become of Byles?”
</p>
<p>
“His mother is very ill, sir, and he had to cry
off at the last moment. I was very lucky to get
a man to fill the place.”
</p>
<p>
“Ha! Looks rather <em>young</em>, doesn’t he? Overgrown,
perhaps. Any <em>good</em>?”
</p>
<p>
“Can’t tell yet, sir. I’ll let you know later
on. He shapes very well. He’s a fine well-made
young fellow; very willing, too. Byles
said he’d go bail for him to any amount.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s all right. What’s his name?”
</p>
<p>
“M’Cracken, sir; Scotch, by the name.
Would you like to speak to him, sir?”
</p>
<p>
“Just a word. Like to <em>know</em> the men, you
know. Gives ’em a personal interest in their
job, I always think.”
</p>
<p>
The engineer called up the new stoker, a tall
young fellow in the flannel shirt open at the neck,
the loose reach-me-down, and the black-lead
coated trousers affected by his kind. His
face and arms were begrimed with black grease,
and his mouth received an extra smudge as he
drew the back of his hand across it, apparently in
sheepish confusion.
</p>
<p>
“You’re a new man, M’Cracken,” said the
merchant pleasantly. “Hope you’ll get on
well. Mr. Mumford won’t <em>over-work</em> you, I can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
answer for that. Have you been long at this
job?”
</p>
<p>
“No that lang, sir; just a wee while,” the
stoker replied in a somewhat husky voice.
</p>
<p>
“Exactly. Ah! well! Good morning.”
</p>
<p>
“Good mornin’, sir.”
</p>
<p>
And Mr. Greatorex went on deck, satisfied
that he had established excellent relations with
the newest hand.
</p>
<p>
The first part of the voyage was rather stormy.
The yacht, by no means a large vessel, shipped
one or two fairly heavy seas, to the no small alarm
of Tom, who was anxious lest the crates containing
his machine should be washed overboard or
otherwise injured. But halfway through the
Bay the weather moderated, and by the time
the yacht reached the latitude of Lisbon both
wind and sea were calm enough, he thought,
for his first experiment. It had been decided
that the dusk of the evening would be the best
time for the attempt, for it was just as necessary
on sea as on land to avoid observation. If the
airship were descried from the deck of a homeward-bound
vessel, the fact, and the name of the
yacht, might be marconigraphed to England,
and then, as Mr. Greatorex said, all Fleet Street
would be in a buzz.
</p>
<p>
Early one morning the crates were broken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
open. It took the best part of the day to piece
the machine together, and Tom went over it
bit by bit several times to assure himself that
everything was in order. The airship was so
placed that it could take flight over the stern of
the yacht. When dusk was falling, the vessel’s
engines were reversed, Tom arranging that as soon
as the airship rose from the deck the yacht should
be sent full speed ahead, to make sure that the
apparatus cleared the vessel and ran no risk of
fouling the funnel.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Greatorex had shown some nervousness
as the critical moment approached. He insisted
on lowering a boat in case the airship came
to grief and Tom were thrown into the sea.
Timothy Ball, too, looked on with a most woful
countenance as the final preparations were made.
He had unslung a life belt, ready to slip into it
and fling himself overboard if the airship broke
down.
</p>
<p>
“I feel sure in my inside it won’t work,” he
said anxiously to Tom, as he stepped to the car.
“It’ll be worse than suicide, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Why worse, Tim?” asked Mr. Greatorex.
</p>
<p>
“‘Cos we’re lookin’ on, sir,” said Tim solemnly,
and felt much hurt by the burst of laughter with
which his explanation was received.
</p>
<p>
But his anxiety was a vain expenditure of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
energy. With the vertical screws at full speed,
and the horizontal screws half speed, the machine
rose like a huge bird from the deck, with a noise
like the clattering of hundreds of bats and the
humming of innumerable bees. At the height
of sixty feet or so Tom stopped the vertical
screws, and turned the full power of his engines
on to the horizontal propellers, giving to the
planes just sufficient inclination to counteract
the force of gravity.
</p>
<p>
“Capital!” exclaimed Mr. Greatorex, as he
watched the easy flight. “First-rate! There’s
a <em>fortune</em> in that, skipper,” he said to Captain
Bodgers at his side.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe,” said the Captain reflectively. He
was a man of few words.
</p>
<p>
“Rather stay on deck, eh?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you can swim in water, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Exactly. But how far is the fellow going?
It’s getting dark, and he’ll be out of sight directly.
By the way, Bodgers, there’s no law about showing
lamps on an airship. But there will be—there
<em>will</em> be. Ah! here he comes—at a spanking
pace, too. He’ll overtake us in no time, going
dead slow as we are.”
</p>
<p>
In less than a minute the airship had come
within a little distance astern of the yacht.
</p>
<p>
“Hallo!” came a voice from the air.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
</p>
<p>
“Are you there?” answered Mr. Greatorex,
from force of habit at the telephone.
</p>
<p>
“Who are you?” came the response. “I
say, Mr. Greatorex, pick up that boat and go full
speed ahead. She’s going beautifully; the oiling
she’s had has done her no end of good.”
</p>
<p>
“All right. Aren’t you coming <em>down</em>? It’s
getting <em>dark</em>; I can hardly <em>see</em> you.”
</p>
<p>
“Not just yet. She goes smoother than the
yacht, and it’s beautifully fresh up here. I can
tell your whereabouts by your lights.”
</p>
<p>
“All right. <em>Don’t get lost!</em>”
</p>
<p>
Tom laughed. He laughed again when, from
his elevated position, he saw that though the
boat had been hoisted on board, four men had
been told off to stand by the davits in order to
lower it again at the first sign of mishap.
</p>
<p>
The yacht was sent full speed ahead. She could
easily do her eighteen knots, but was no match
in speed for the airship, which circled round
and round her.
</p>
<p>
“She beats us hollow,” said Mr. Mumford
to M’Cracken, as they watched the flight from
the foot of the companion.
</p>
<p>
“Ou ay, sir. Yon’s a grand invention. It’s
wonderful.”
</p>
<p>
After about an hour Tom called down that
he was going to descend.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
</p>
<p>
“He’d much better stay up now he’s there,”
said Timothy, gloomily. “He’ll smash himself
or us—I know he will.”
</p>
<p>
Tom knew that to descend was a delicate
operation, to be performed with all caution.
As his control over the airship was to a great
extent proportionate to its speed, he shouted
instructions to keep the yacht going under full
steam. Coming up astern, he so adjusted his
own speed as to overtake the yacht very slowly.
When the airship was level with the stern, two
men on board caught a cable hanging loose from
the car. Then Tom gradually reduced the
speed of the horizontal propellers, and started
the vertical screws at half speed, keeping one
hand all the time on the lever that adjusted the
angles of the planes. He handled his appliances so
dexterously that the airship, guided by the rope,
sank steadily and accurately to the deck. Buffers
of india rubber were slipped under her bottom
to break the slight jar that must be inevitable
when she touched the platform. Then Tom
stepped out.
</p>
<p>
“Capital!” cried Mr. Greatorex, slapping
him on the back. “This is going to turn out
<em>all right</em>, my boy. What does it <em>feel</em> like, being
up there?”
</p>
<p>
“Like a fish out of water, I should think,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
said Tom, laughing. “But I thought what a
helpless thing a man-of-war would be if she had
to tackle an airship. I could choose my own altitude,
and drop explosives on her deck and blow
her to smithereens, and there’s no gun that I know
of that could make an effective reply. They’d
have to invent a rocket apparatus for shying
melinite shells aloft.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, let’s hope that it’ll never come to that.
Ours is a <em>cooling</em> apparatus—don’t you forget
it!”
</p>
<p>
Tom was so well pleased with his first sea trial
that day had scarcely dawned before he was again
aloft. This time he took Timothy with him.
He needed some assistance in attending to the
mechanism, and now that a first ascent had been
made without mishap, the man was no longer
so nervous about it.
</p>
<p>
The airship had not been up more than half
an hour, however, when Tom signalled to the
yacht that he saw a vessel on the horizon.
</p>
<p>
“Come down <em>at once</em>!” roared Mr. Greatorex
through a megaphone.
</p>
<p>
Tom descended, somewhat unwillingly.
Nothing would have pleased him better than to
steer directly for the vessel, and see what effect
was produced on board by the sight of this strange
bird of passage hovering above the tops. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
clearly Mr. Greatorex was right, and Tom
lowered the machine deftly to the deck. As the
ship was heading straight for the yacht, the
aeroplane was covered with tarpaulin.
</p>
<p>
The vessel turned out to be a cruiser flying
the French colours. The captain spoke the
yacht, and asked whether anything had been
seen from its deck of an extraordinary object
that appeared to have been moving through the
air.
</p>
<p>
“Answer him, Tom. I’m no good at French.”
</p>
<p>
“We did see something, monsieur le capitaine,”
he said, “Do you know whether Monsieur
Santos-Dumont is trying his thirty-third airship?”
</p>
<p>
“I am not aware, monsieur. It may be. I
saw the object very indistinctly. It suddenly
disappeared.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah! I was always afraid that Monsieur
Santos-Dumont would meet his death. You
French, monsieur, are such adventurous spirits!
When you reach Brest perhaps you will inquire
whether he has recently made an ascent.”
</p>
<p>
“I will certainly do so, monsieur.”
</p>
<p>
The vessels were now out of speaking distance.
Tom explained to Mr. Greatorex what he had
said.
</p>
<p>
“Bravo! What with my cooling apparatus
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
and your cool cheek I think we are keeping our
secret pretty well, Tom.”
</p>
<p>
In order to escape further observation from passing
vessels Mr. Greatorex had the yacht’s course
set considerably westward of the usual track.
It was consequently another couple of days before
she came into the latitude of Rabat, the port for
which she was making. Her head was turned
eastward in the direction of the coast of Morocco,
and, there being no vessels in sight, Tom again
made an ascent, Timothy accompanying him.
</p>
<p>
The coastline gradually came into view. From
an altitude of more than a hundred feet Tom
saw, between him and the coast, a number of
rocky islets. Here and there the varying tints
of the water indicated shoals of sunken rocks.
</p>
<p>
“Know the coast?” he called down to Captain
Bodgers.
</p>
<p>
“Ay, ay, sir,” said the captain.
</p>
<p>
“There are no end of shoals.”
</p>
<p>
“Know ’em all, sir; have a care you don’t
strike one.”
</p>
<p>
Captain Bodgers laughed uproariously at his
little joke, and Tom, circling round the yacht,
set the aeroplane at full speed towards the coast.
He was a considerable distance ahead when
Timothy suddenly called his attention to an
object projecting above the sea-level, close to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
one of the rocky islets that dotted the intervening
space. It might have escaped their attention
altogether but for a certain movement Tim
fancied he discerned in it. As they drew nearer,
they discovered that what Tim had thought to
be a single object was in reality two, which
appeared to be the broken-off stumps of two masts.
Taking his field-glasses in one hand—the other
always grasping the steering wheel—Tom lifted
them to his eyes, got the focus, and made out
that the objects were not stumps after all, but
the tops of masts, and that two figures were
clinging to them, one to each.
</p>
<p>
Tom had no doubt that the airship was approaching
the scene of a wreck, and that the two
men were in distress and danger. Steering
immediately for the yacht, he came within
hailing distance and through his megaphone
announced his discovery.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll go to the rescue, <em>of course</em>,” shouted
Mr. Greatorex in reply.
</p>
<p>
The wreck was as yet invisible from the deck,
but it was arranged that the yacht should stand
in as close as possible, and then send a boat to
bring off the survivors. Meanwhile Tom, setting
his engine at full speed, dashed on in the direction
of the submerged vessel.
</p>
<p>
He noticed that even during the few seconds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
in which he had been in communication with
the yacht the situation had changed. One of
the masts was now tenantless. Presumably its
occupant had been washed off or through fatigue
had dropped into the sea. But as the airship
drew rapidly nearer, it was noticed that the figure
on the other mast was bending low as if to raise
something from the water. Then a head and
shoulders appeared above the surface. Clearly
the man Tom had supposed to be lost was trying
to make his way to the mast to which his
companion clung.
</p>
<p>
The airship was now less than half a mile
distant, and from the altitude to which they
had risen—some three hundred feet above the
surface—the occupants could see every detail
in the strange drama that was being enacted
beneath them. Assisted by the figure above,
the swimmer was gradually making his way on
to the mast, when suddenly a black fin appeared
above the surface a few yards off. With a convulsive
movement, the lowermost man had just
succeeded in swinging himself a foot or two up
the mast when the gaping jaws of a shark passed
immediately beneath him. Tom shuddered involuntarily.
The man had escaped by a few
inches at the most.
</p>
<p>
In a second the shark turned and glided beneath
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
the clinging figure. The terror-stricken wretch
clutched wildly at the man above him, and began
to haul himself up hand over hand, clinging to
his companion’s body. But the latter, unable
to bear the double weight on the smooth mast,
slipped slowly downwards. He was the slighter
of the two, and no match, apparently, for the
man who had usurped his place.
</p>
<p>
“What a beast!” ejaculated Tom, wondering
at this strange want of fellow-feeling in a man
who was evidently older and stronger than his
companion in distress. Slowing down, he fixed
his eyes on the extraordinary spectacle. The
position was now reversed. The younger and
slighter man was very manifestly the under dog.
With every attempt on his part to swarm up
the mast the man above him kicked savagely,
while the shark circled below. The fact that
the second mast had become untenable seemed to
indicate that the tide was rising. Neither of the
men, their whole attention fixed on the sea
beneath, had noticed the airship that was now
hovering just above their heads.
</p>
<p>
When, however, Tom gradually allowed the
airship to sink towards the sea, the shark seemed
to take fright, just as smaller fish are scared by
signs of movement in the air above. It left the
immediate neighbourhood of the mast, and its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
black fin could be seen describing a much larger
circle some two or three hundred yards away.
Clearly it had not given up hope. When the
shark moved away and the strain of terror was
relaxed, the two men became suddenly aware of
the presence of the airship. The topmost man
was almost as much scared by the sight of the
airship as he had been by the presence of the
shark. Tom had already noticed that both of
the men were dark skinned. The larger and
stronger—the brute, as Tom mentally called
him—appeared to be middle-aged; the other
was a stripling.
</p>
<p>
Tom was struck by the difference in their
demeanour when they caught sight of the airship;
neither he nor Timothy was at present
visible to them. The elder man was aghast with
fright, his eyes dilated, his mouth gaped between
black moustache and beard. The younger, however,
seemed to pull himself together as with
renewed hope. Tom fancied that he heard a
cry from his lips.
</p>
<p>
Looking round, Tom saw that the yacht had
now hove to, and the boat was leaving her side.
But his attention was again called to the wreck
by a piercing shriek. The shark, regaining confidence,
had made another dash at the mast.
This time it seemed to come within an inch of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
the terrified youth; indeed, from the cry that
had reached his ears, Tom thought that the poor
wretch had actually been seized. But next
moment he saw that the shark had again drawn
off, scared, possibly, by the cry.
</p>
<p>
There was now less of the masts above the
surface. The tide was evidently rising, and with
its rise the shark would have another opportunity
of coming within snapping distance. Tom
felt that it would not again fail. It would be
at least ten minutes before the boat reached the
spot; by that time the hapless lad would probably
have fallen a victim. Tom had noticed
that when the shark was all but upon him, and
he made a convulsive movement upwards, he
was met by a storm of kicks from the man above,
threatening to dislodge him completely from
the mast and hurl him into the very jaws of the
monster.
</p>
<p>
In a moment Tom made up his mind. He
ordered Timothy to let down from the car a
light grapnel carried for use in emergencies, and
also for raising anything that might be needed,
without having to bring the airship to rest on
the ground. Then he allowed the machine to
sink gently until the grapnel dangled within
reach of the man at the top. Tom had no
intention of helping him first; by his conduct
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
he deserved to be left to drown or to make a meal
for the shark. But the man seemed indeed
quite incapable of movement, except when
scared to frenzy by the efforts of the youth below to
regain the position from which he had been forced.
He made no attempt to clutch the grapnel
dangling at his very hand. Tom let the machine
fall lower, until the grapnel came within reach
of the younger man. He showed no such hesitation.
Looking along the cable, he saw Timothy
gazing down at him from the car. The sight of
a human face gave him confidence. He clutched
at the grapnel, let go his hold of the mast, and
swung clear, Timothy attempting to steady the
rope.
</p>
<p>
His sudden movement threatened a catastrophe.
The airship was now only about sixty feet above the
sea, and before Tom, his attention partly engaged
by the efforts of the boy, could increase the speed
of the ascensional screw, the light vessel was
pulled swiftly downwards. For a moment he
felt that it must inevitably be dragged into the
water. The young fellow below, still clutching
desperately at the grapnel, had actually begun
to sink beneath the surface. But as soon as his
weight was supported by the water, the ascensional
screw, now set by Tom whirling at full
speed, checked the downward movement, and in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
another couple of seconds the airship began to
rise, dragging the youth upwards.
</p>
<p>
In his excitement Tom had momentarily
forgotten the shark. That persistent creature,
however, having overcome its fear of the monster
of the air, made a dash for the youth as he entered
the sea. The poor wretch had the narrowest
escape of all when the shark passed just beneath
him, as, whirling round on the grapnel, he was
swung clear of the water.
</p>
<p>
Now that he was safe from the cruel jaws, the
lad showed himself to be possessed of no little
agility. Hand over hand he swarmed up the
cable until he reached the lower rail of the car,
which he clutched, and by Timothy’s aid he
clambered over. Meanwhile Tom had steered
the airship towards the approaching boat.
</p>
<p>
“Give way with a will, men!” he shouted.
“There’s no time to be lost. We’ve got
one; the other man will be nabbed by a shark
if you aren’t there pretty soon. I can see the
brute’s fin above the water just by the mast.”
</p>
<p>
The men spurted. As the boat approached
the submerged vessel, the shark took fright and
glided swiftly away. In another half-minute the
man was taken from his precarious perch, and
lifted, in a state of complete collapse, into the
boat.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI—SALATHIEL BEN EZRA</h2>
<p>
“Bismillah!” ejaculated the young Moor
when he stood in the car.
</p>
<p>
“Just saved your bacon, if that’s what you
mean,” said Timothy. “And a nice sloppy
mess you’re making! I s’pose <em>I</em>‘ll have to clean
up.”
</p>
<p>
Timothy scowled and growled, but that was
only his way. Tom knew well enough that
Timothy would clean up with great cheerfulness.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll get back to the yacht,” he said, “and
find some dry things for him there.”
</p>
<p>
The airship was now so well under control
that Tom had no difficulty in letting her down
safely on deck, though the yacht was at anchor.
</p>
<p>
“Uncommonly well done!” exclaimed Mr.
Greatorex as Tom stepped out of the car.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; I thought she came down pretty
neatly,” said Tom.
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t mean <em>that</em>, you egoist. I meant you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
saved this young fellow uncommonly well; saw
it <em>all</em> through my binocular. Dangerous things,
sharks. Who <em>is</em> the boy?”
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t asked him yet. I thought we
might give him a dry change and then see if we
can make out anything. He probably can’t
speak English.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well. Bodgers, find some toggery and
take him into the cabin. Who’s the <em>other</em>
fellow?”
</p>
<p>
“We shall find out presently. Shall we go
into the cabin? I’d like to put a few questions
before the other man comes aboard.”
</p>
<p>
They found that Captain Bodgers had rigged
up the boy in a sailor’s suit much too large for
him.
</p>
<p>
“Capital!” cried Mr. Greatorex. “<em>Much</em>
more respectable! Can you speak English,
boy?”
</p>
<p>
“Me speak English little bit, and Spanish
little bit,” replied the boy with a frank smile.
</p>
<p>
“That’s capital! Not the <em>Spanish</em>, you know;
but the English.”
</p>
<p>
“I tank very much for the gentleman’s goodness——”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes, <em>that’s</em> all right. But come now,
how did you get into that pretty pickle?”
</p>
<p>
The boy looked puzzled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
</p>
<p>
“Tell us how the ship came to be wrecked,”
said Tom, translating.
</p>
<p>
“Aiyeh! She caught in fog last night, struck
rock. Quick it was all over; no one live, only
me and Salathiel ben Ezra.”
</p>
<p>
“That is your friend’s name, is it? A Jew?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, excellency, a Jew. A dog of a Jew!”
</p>
<p>
“And you are not a Jew? What is your
name?”
</p>
<p>
“Abdul, most merciful—Abdul ben Cassim,
of Ain Afroo in Zemmur.”
</p>
<p>
“Zemmur!” ejaculated Mr. Greatorex. “Isn’t
that the neighbourhood where Ingleton is said
to be?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” replied Tom. “We may find the lad
useful. Tell us, Abdul, how you came to be at
sea with a Jew.”
</p>
<p>
Abdul explained that, some five or six years
before, his father, a well-to-do saddlemaker of
Ain Afroo, had contrived to quarrel with the
sheikh of his district, refusing, in fact, to pay
the sheikh a very extortionate levy. It was,
Abdul admitted, a foolish thing to do, for soon
afterwards the saddlemaker died mysteriously.
His family took instant flight with what possessions
they could get together, and found refuge
in Casa Blanca, where the boy had a distant
relative, the owner of a small coasting vessel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
Since that time he had been engaged in trading
up and down the coast, and in his journeyings had
picked up a smattering of English and Spanish.
</p>
<p>
The small capital which the family had brought
with them had been considerably increased by
profitable investments in trading ventures of
the lad’s kinsman. A share in the business was
owned by Salathiel ben Ezra, the Jew who was
now being brought from the wreck in the yacht’s
boat. It was very unlucky; Abdul could not
but think that the wreck must have been caused
by an evil spell cast on the boat by the Jew;
for Salathiel had never voyaged on the vessel
before. The loss of the ship meant the loss of
almost the whole of his family’s little fortune,
and Abdul feared they would be placed in the
power of Salathiel, who already had some claim
on them which Abdul himself did not understand.
But everything happened by the will of Allah;
it was written, and what is written must be.
</p>
<p>
Abdul’s story was hardly finished when the
Jew was hauled on board. He appeared to have
quite regained his self-possession during the
short passage of the boat. He made a deep
obeisance when Mr. Greatorex met him on deck.
</p>
<p>
“I pay a thousand dutiful civilities,” he said
in a low smooth voice. “The honourable sir
overwhelms me with kindness in saving me and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
my humble companion from the jaws of the
monster, and my thanks are even as the sand of
the shore. May I beg the little loan of a dry
garment or two?”
</p>
<p>
“Take Mr. Salathiel below, Captain Bodgers,”
said Mr. Greatorex, “and see what you can do
for him.”
</p>
<p>
With a deep salaam and a fawning smile the
Jew departed.
</p>
<p>
“Um!” grunted Mr. Greatorex. “Don’t
like his <em>looks</em>, Tom.”
</p>
<p>
“He’s not prepossessing, certainly; a little too
glib, don’t you think?”
</p>
<p>
“A <em>rascal</em>, Tom; mark my words.”
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t go so far as that. But we may
get something out of this, Mr. Greatorex. This
young Moor comes from the very country where
Ingleton is said to be. Don’t you think we
may profit by that?”
</p>
<p>
“How do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, instead of making for Rabat, as we
intended, why not find some quieter harbour
where we shall not be such public characters,
and get the youngster to act as guide into the
hills? No doubt he bears a grudge against
the sheikh who disposed of his father. If he
has anything of the usual oriental thirst for
revenge he will be very willing to help us.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, sound him; go at it <em>cautiously</em>, you
know; <em>tact</em>—that’s the thing.”
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Salathiel ben Ezra had been clothed
by Captain Bodgers in blue serge trousers, a
nankeen waistcoat, and an oilskin, the only other
garment available. The Jew cut a strange
figure in this unfamiliar attire. He was short,
fat, thick-necked; the lower part of his face
was hidden by dense black moustache and beard;
his eyes were unequal in size and different in
colour, and had a trick of roaming all around as
he talked.
</p>
<p>
“This is very elegant yacht,” he said to Captain
Bodgers as the garments were laid before him.
The captain, always a silent man, made no reply.
“That is most marvellous creature, the thing
that flies in the air,” the Jew continued; “I
have never seen anything like it. It is without
doubt a new sport—the English love sport. They
spend much money in sport. And where is
the yacht bound for, good captain?”
</p>
<p>
“Goin’ a cruise,” said the captain shortly.
</p>
<p>
“Without doubt. And perhaps the kind
governor will permit to call at a port—at Rabat,
say; for I am not a man of the sea, and I have
business there.”
</p>
<p>
“Better ask him.”
</p>
<p>
“I will do so. I will say also how I fill myself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
with wonder of the thing that flies. I myself
am a sport!”
</p>
<p>
Salathiel not merely expressed his wonderment
to Mr. Greatorex, but displayed a very active
curiosity as to the construction of the machine
and the choice of those waters for the practice
of the new sport. Mr. Greatorex gave him no
satisfaction, and was indeed somewhat curt in
his replies to the man’s leading questions; but
Salathiel smiled at each rebuff, thereby confirming
Mr. Greatorex’s conviction that he was
a rascal.
</p>
<p>
The yacht lay to for several hours, getting
under way again in the afternoon. It was very
hot; everybody was more or less sleepy, and
Tom thought it a good time to sound the Moor
as to his willingness to assist in the expedition.
They had a long conversation in the cabin, the
result of which was entirely satisfactory to Tom.
Abdul’s one object in life was to wreak vengeance
on the sheikh for the wrongs his family had
suffered, and it was to be a thorough vengeance.
He would not be satisfied merely with the death
of his enemy; that might have been achieved
already. But he was determined to ruin the
sheikh’s family, just as his own had been ruined.
He had hoped to save enough money in course
of time to gather about him a band of trusty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
Riffians who would raid the oppressor’s stronghold.
The loss of the vessel had swept away the savings
of five years; but he was resolved to begin again
and even if fifty years were to pass before he
was in a position to accomplish his aim, he would
never relinquish it. The sheikh himself might
die before then; in that case the weight of the
avenging hand would fall on his descendants.
</p>
<p>
When Tom reported to Mr. Greatorex the
result of this conversation the worthy merchant
was shocked.
</p>
<p>
“Terrible, terrible!” he said. “Most unchristian!
The Moors are no better than <em>heathen</em>,
Tom.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, we don’t know what it’s like. I don’t
think you would be very sweetly disposed towards
any one who had served you as he has been
served.”
</p>
<p>
“Me! I’d bring an <em>action</em> against the villain,
you may be sure of that.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t suppose they have actions at law in
Morocco. But it’s quite clear that he will be
willing to help us.”
</p>
<p>
“True. I’ll go down with you, and we’ll
come to an understanding with him.”
</p>
<p>
At this second interview Tom explained to
Abdul the object he had in view, and invited
his assistance, Mr. Greatorex promising that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
if he would guide Tom to the spot where the
British diplomatist was held captive he should
be rewarded with a sum equal to what he had
lost through the wreck. Further, if Sir Mark
Ingleton should actually be got away safely, the
sum should be doubled. Abdul jumped at the
offer, and listened respectfully enough when
Mr. Greatorex went on to say that he hoped
the money would not be put to bad uses.
</p>
<p>
“Everything happens by the will of Allah,”
he said; “what is to be, must be.”
</p>
<p>
It was dusk when the little party broke up.
Nobody noticed a figure wriggle away from a
ventilating grating over the skylight of the cabin.
Salathiel ben Ezra had watched these conferences
between the Moor and the Christians with much
curiosity and suspicion, and without attracting
the attention of any one on deck he had contrived
to steal to a spot where he overheard a considerable
part of the conversation.
</p>
<p>
Before he turned in, Tom had a long talk
with Mr. Greatorex, which took an unexpected
trend. The two were alone in the cabin. Tom
was in the highest spirits, for the greatest difficulty
he had foreseen—the difficulty of finding
his way about the hill village when he should
arrive at it—seemed to have been removed now
that he had secured a guide in Abdul.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
</p>
<p>
“You see, it’s just about there,” he said, putting
his finger down on the map he had unrolled
and spread on the table. “It is barely a hundred
miles inland, and without putting any strain on
the engines I can do it comfortably in four hours.
Of course, we must arrive after dark; so to-morrow
night I think we’ll make a start—Timothy
and I and the Moor.”
</p>
<p>
Then it was that the unexpected happened.
Mr. Greatorex had been staring gravely at the
map. Suddenly he brought his fist down on
it with a bang.
</p>
<p>
“Look here, Tom,” he said, “we’ll <em>drop</em> it.”
</p>
<p>
Tom was taken too much aback for words.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, we’ll drop it. I won’t <em>allow</em> it. Suppose
anything goes wrong with the machine, where
<em>are</em> you? tell me that! In those hills—wild
country, wild men—<em>fanatics</em>, you know: hate
all Christians, no sense of law and order, won’t
pay their taxes, don’t care tuppence for their
rulers—oh! I’ve <em>read</em> all about ’em, you know,
and ‘pon my soul I don’t know what I was thinking
of to come out here at all. We’ve had a pleasant
run, we’ve tested the airship; it’ll <em>do</em>, Tom:
but now we’ll go <em>back</em>, my boy, to our land of
peace and settled government.”
</p>
<p>
“But what about Sir Mark Ingleton?”
</p>
<p>
“Hang Ingleton! Ingleton never invented
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
anything! If those Moors get hold of you,
England loses an inventor and I lose my man.
No, no; we mustn’t meddle with state affairs.”
</p>
<p>
And then Tom spent an hour in patiently
combatting Mr. Greatorex’s objections, and in
the end had for his meagre reward the indecisive
remark—
</p>
<p>
“Well, we’ll see, Tom, we’ll <em>see</em>.”
</p>
<p>
Next morning Mr. Greatorex made no allusion
to this conversation, but was observed in close
colloquy with Captain Bodgers. The result of
this removed the weight from Tom’s mind.
The yacht coasted up and down, the captain
scanning the desolate shore narrowly through
his glass. At last he found what he had been
searching for, and steered the yacht into a snug
little bay. The country was well wooded, the
trees coming down almost to the edge of the
narrow sandy beach.
</p>
<p>
“Can’t better this, sir,” said the captain.
“The anchorage is none too good, and if a storm
comes up we may have to put out to sea; but
it’s a quiet place, as you see; can’t do no
better.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well. Now, Tom, I’m going to risk
it. There’s the <em>Country</em> to consider, you see.
But you’ll make me a promise not to run into
danger; I know you won’t run away from it!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
</p>
<p>
“With all my heart,” replied Tom. “We’ll
start to-night.”
</p>
<p>
He spent the hours of daylight in making
preparations. The machine was overhauled;
provisions and arms were stowed in the car;
and Tom eagerly awaited the moment for setting
forth on his adventure.
</p>
<p>
In the afternoon, while the preparations were
still in progress, a crowd of natives appeared on
the cliffs south of the bay—wild-looking men
clad in djellabas and kaftans and yellow shoes,
and all armed with long guns. They made no
attempt to open communication with the yacht,
but encamped on the cliff as though to keep an
eye on her movements.
</p>
<p>
Some little time afterwards, a small native
craft was observed entering the cove. Her
appearance was hailed with shouts from the cliff,
where there were signs of excitement among the
throng of spectators.
</p>
<p>
“Barbary pirates, eh, Bodgers!” said Mr.
Greatorex, taking a look at the felucca through
his glass.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe, sir; they’ve plied that trade hereabouts
for hundreds of years.”
</p>
<p>
“They’re making for the yacht.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. We’ll serve out arms, sir; it’s as well
to be on the safe side.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
</p>
<p>
“Tom, cover up the airship. I don’t suppose
they’ll know what it is, but, as Bodgers says,
it’s as well to be on the safe side.”
</p>
<p>
As the vessel drew near, it was seen that she
carried some thirty fierce-looking fellows, tall
and finely made. One of them hailed the yacht.
Mr. Greatorex called Abdul to his side and bade
him interpret.
</p>
<p>
“Say they want to come on ship, sir—see the
captain—do trade for guns and powder.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you say, Bodgers? Shall we let
a few of them come aboard?”
</p>
<p>
“I would, sir. A few won’t do no harm, and
if we can make friends of them, so much the
better.”
</p>
<p>
Accordingly, half a dozen Moors were allowed
to mount to the yacht’s deck. They appeared
to be much disappointed when Mr. Greatorex
politely explained through Abdul that he had
no commercial object; his ostensible purpose,
to see the country, scarcely satisfied them. But
they recovered their spirits when he offered to
show them over the vessel; and afterwards
when, at the suggestion of Captain Bodgers, who
knew something of the Moorish habits, they were
each given a cup of weak tea and unlimited sugar,
they smacked their lips and declared themselves
well pleased with their reception.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
</p>
<p>
While they were still sipping their tea, squatting
on the deck, Salathiel ben Ezra, who had hitherto
kept in the background, came to Mr. Greatorex
and begged the favour of a few minutes’ conversation.
</p>
<p>
“I ask you, excellency, to be so kind, as let
me go with the men, when they leave this ship.
I have business on land; and thank you for your
kindness, and take leave respectfully.”
</p>
<p>
“Hm! Moors <em>friends</em> of yours, eh?”
</p>
<p>
“No, no; the Moors do not love the men
of my nation; they oppress us; they call us dogs
and sons of swine.”
</p>
<p>
“Well then, you’d better stay aboard, you
know. You wouldn’t be <em>safe</em> among them in a
wild spot like this. We can land you at Rabat
in a day or two; you’ll be safer in a port.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, excellency, but I do not love the sea.
It has wrecked my vessel; I have much fear of
the sharks. I am not at ease until I set foot
again on dry land.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Greatorex was perplexed. He had no
reasonable excuse for detaining the Jew: yet,
remembering that the man had seen the airship
at work, he recognized that it would be in the
highest degree impolitic to allow him to go ashore
and spread the news. He beckoned Tom forward
and told him of the Jew’s request. Tom instantly
grasped the situation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Salathiel forgets,” he said, “that we
have a claim for salvage on his effects. (Whether
we have such a claim legally I don’t know,”
he said to Mr. Greatorex afterwards, “but it
was the first thing that came into my head.”)
</p>
<p>
“That is most true,” said the Jew, with a
smile; “but alas! I lost everything in the wreck;
and have only my clothes, and they——”
</p>
<p>
He shrugged expressively.
</p>
<p>
“Sorry for you,” said Tom. “Still, it would
not be fair to your companion Abdul to leave
him to meet our claim alone.”
</p>
<p>
“But he can come with me,” said Salathiel
eagerly. “He will be with his countrymen.”
</p>
<p>
“You were not so anxious for his company
when I first saw you,” replied Tom drily. “No,
Mr. Salathiel; it will be better for you both to
come with us to Rabat: there we can lay this
little matter of salvage before the authorities.”
</p>
<p>
The Jew heaved a sigh as of weariness, and
acquiesced with a smile. Neither Tom nor Mr.
Greatorex was aware that while the Moors were
being shown over the vessel, Salathiel had had a
few moments’ conversation with one of them.
The only man on board who had observed this—and
he had not given a second thought to it—was
M’Cracken, the new stoker.
</p>
<p>
The Moors left the yacht; the felucca sailed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
away; not shorewards, as Tom had expected, but
out to sea. The crowd on the cliff dispersed
and disappeared, and Tom’s final preparations
were made unobserved.
</p>
<p>
Night fell, and the little bay, hemmed in by
the surrounding cliffs, was enveloped in pitchy
darkness. Ten o’clock had been fixed as the
time for the ascent of the airship, and up to
the last moment Tom employed himself in seeing
that all was right. Mr. Greatorex was fidgety,
asking the same questions, repeating the same
warnings, over and over again, until Tom began
to fear that even now he would change his mind
and prohibit the expedition. His excitement
infected every member of the crew. The men
had eyes only for the wonderful machine and
for the figures that moved to and fro about it in
the light of the yacht’s electric lamps. Even
the men of the watch were diverted from their
duties when they perceived that the lashings
holding the airship to the deck were being cast
loose. Thus it was that no one had observed a
small craft gliding into the bay; no one had
noticed that a rope hung over the side of the
yacht from the main deck forward; no one was
on the look-out when a dusky form clambered
silently up and helped to lower Salathiel ben
Ezra into the boat riding alongside.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
</p>
<p>
But it happened that Timothy Ball, going
forward at that moment to fetch his reefer,
which he had left in the fore cabin, noticed what
was afoot just as he reached the companion way.
With a shout he dashed forward to lay hands
on the intruder. But, quick as thought, the
Moor whipped out a knife and struck at Timothy;
and when the sailors came running to the spot
they found the poor fellow groaning on the
deck, and caught a glimpse of a felucca speeding
away into the gloom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
</p>
<h2><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>CHAPTER VII—THE HILLS OF ZEMMUR</h2>
<p>
For the moment the airship was forgotten.
The whole ship’s company flocked to the
foredeck and formed a group around the prostrate
form of Timothy Ball. Tom was already on
his knees beside the man, putting in practice
the principles of first aid, and receiving unexpected
assistance from M’Cracken, who showed remarkable
adeptness.
</p>
<p>
“How did it <em>happen</em>?” cried Mr. Greatorex,
supposing that his man’s plight was due to some
accident.
</p>
<p>
“The Jew!” said Timothy, faintly.
</p>
<p>
“The villain! Bring him <em>here</em>, some one.”
</p>
<p>
“He ain’t here, sir; went over the side. It
wasn’t him that stabbed me; it was a Moor that
came up out of a boat and helped the Jew to get
away. Never mind me, sir; I’m all right.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Greatorex fumed.
</p>
<p>
“This puts a <em>stop</em> to it, Tom. It’s a villainous
business, and we’ll go straight back home.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
</p>
<p>
Tom made no reply. He was completing
the adjustment of a tourniquet.
</p>
<p>
“And we’ve no doctor on board!” Mr.
Greatorex went on. “We’ll run back to Gibraltar
and get assistance. Can’t let the poor
fellow bleed to <em>death</em>, you know.”
</p>
<p>
“He’ll no bleed to death,” said M’Cracken
huskily. “It’s just a wee flesh wound. He’ll
be a’ richt in a twa-three days.”
</p>
<p>
“Glad to hear it.”
</p>
<p>
“The question is, who shall I take with me
now?” said Tom, rising to his feet and ignoring
Mr. Greatorex’s expressed determination to go
home. “The sooner I’m off the better, for that
rascally Jew will tell all he knows about the airship,
and the Moors will be on their guard.”
</p>
<p>
“But we’re going <em>home</em>, Tom.”
</p>
<p>
“Surely you won’t let our enterprise be ruined
by a rogue!” replied Tom. “There’s all the
more reason for going on with it.”
</p>
<p>
“Gad, you’re right,” cried Mr. Greatorex,
veering round again. “We’ll do it in the <em>teeth</em>
of them. But you’ll want some one with you in
place of Tim. If I were twenty years younger
I’d go myself. You want a man who knows
<em>something</em> about engines. Can’t spare <em>you</em>,
Mumford, I’m afraid.”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir,” replied the engineer, “and I’m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
rather heavy. But there’s young M’Cracken;
he’s a light weight; an uncommonly handy
fellow too, and judging from some remarks of
his when we’ve been watching the airship,
he knows something about ’em; seems to have
read a good deal. I can do without him for a
day or two, especially if we lie at anchor here.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah! Yes! Where <em>is</em> he? He was here a
few seconds ago.”
</p>
<p>
M’Cracken was haled from below. He appeared
even more grimy than ever.
</p>
<p>
“Look here, M’Cracken,” said Mr. Greatorex.
“Mr. Dorrell wants some one to <em>help</em> him, and
Mr. Mumford suggests you: speaks <em>well</em> of you,
you know. You’ve never been on an airship, of
course; but all you’ve to do is to keep <em>calm</em>, and
do <em>exactly</em> as you are told. You’re not <em>afraid</em>—no
<em>nerves</em>, oh?”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re very hoarse still. It will do you
<em>good</em>, you know, to be away from that furnace
for a day or two. Well, you’d better get a wash.”
</p>
<p>
“No time for that,” said Tom quickly. “It’s
past ten o’clock, and we ought to have started
long ago.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well. You’re not going <em>visiting</em>, to be
sure. Well, M’Cracken, go and put on your
reefer; the night’s cold, and will be colder.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
</p>
<p>
“Ay, ay, sir,” returned M’Cracken, and
dived with alacrity below. He was back in less
than a minute. Then Tom entered the car of
the airship, followed by Abdul and the stoker.
With one hand on the steering wheel and the
other on the lever controlling the engines, he
called to the men to cast loose the ropes securing
the car to the deck. Then he started the
ascensional screw, and with a whirr like that of
a gigantic humming-top the airship rose slowly
from the yacht’s deck.
</p>
<p>
“Good-bye, Tom,” shouted Mr. Greatorex.
“Be <em>careful</em>, my boy; run no risks.”
</p>
<p>
“Good-bye! Good-bye!”
</p>
<p>
“This is ripping,” said the stoker, as the
machine rose higher and higher into the air.
</p>
<p>
Tom started so violently that he unconsciously
jerked back the lever and stopped the motion
of the machine.
</p>
<p>
“Pull that lever, quick!” he called.
</p>
<p>
“Done it already,” said the stoker, with his
hand on the lever that adjusted the planes.
“Lucky I’ve been up before, Dorrell.”
</p>
<p>
“Good heavens, you’re—yes, you’re Oliphant.
Whew! won’t the old man be in a tantrum.
How in the world did you disguise yourself?”
</p>
<p>
“Sammy Byles’ clothes, a little lampblack,
and my native brogue do make a difference,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
don’t they! I’m afraid Mr. Greatorex <em>will</em> be
a trifle fizzy; but that won’t matter, afterwards.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not sure I oughtn’t to go back and
drop you.”
</p>
<p>
“Nonsense. I’m in for it now, and when
you come to think of it you couldn’t have a better
man. Bar Timothy, nobody knows so much
about the machine as I do; and I warrant I’m
a better hand in a scrimmage, whether with fists
or revolvers. I’ve brought my Colt.”
</p>
<p>
It was some time before Tom recovered from
his surprise; but for the moment his attention
was occupied by the airship. At last he said—
</p>
<p>
“Well, Oliphant, I’m glad enough to have
you with me. I hope we shall come through
all right.”
</p>
<p>
While speaking, he had stopped the ascensional
screws and set the horizontal going. A small
aneroid hung just above his head, lit by a carefully
screened electric lamp. The reading indicated
that the airship had risen to a height of
five hundred metres. Maintaining the ascent
solely by the inclination of the planes, Tom
brought the whole force of the engines to bear
on the horizontal screws, and the machine glided
onwards at a speed of some twenty miles an hour,
gradually rising as she went. Then, at the
altitude of a thousand metres, when Tom judged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
that he was high enough to clear the tops of
the hills that fringed the coast, Oliphant reduced
the angle of the planes so that it was just sufficient
to maintain a constant height at the increased
speed of twenty-five miles.
</p>
<p>
“By Jove, this <em>is</em> ripping!” cried Oliphant
again.
</p>
<p>
It was a bright starlit night, without a breath
of wind. At this altitude the air was crisp and
keen, producing a sense of exhilaration in the
occupants of the car. Even Abdul, who had
quaked inwardly and clutched the rail when
the machine rose to such a giddy height, had now
lost his tremors, and looked around him with
wonderment and delight. The ship was soaring
over the land, which lay outstretched like a vast
black floor three-quarters of a mile beneath.
Behind, the lights of the yacht could be faintly
distinguished; before, there was not a glimmer
over the whole country. The airship crossed
a peak or two, then sailed over a rolling plain;
by and by more hills loomed black in front.
The aneroid, an extremely delicate instrument,
now indicated that the machine was slowly
sinking. Oliphant again adjusted the planes;
the airship passed clear of the hills, and Tom
steered as directly as he could guess for the spot
he had marked on his map.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
</p>
<p>
When the voyage had lasted for about an hour
the rising moon threw more light on the scene,
lending a weird beauty to the variegated landscape—bare
rugged hills alternating with wooded
slopes and dark valleys. But it was impossible,
at the height at which they were sailing, to distinguish
any landmarks; Abdul knew the country
thoroughly, but was quite at a loss in this unfamiliar
situation. He had told Tom that the
fastness where the diplomatist was probably
held captive stood on the top of an extremely
steep hill, and explained that the most convenient
spot from which to approach it was a
small tableland about a sixth of a day’s journey
from it. This was Tom’s objective; but as it
was impossible to make sure of reaching it unless
Abdul could obtain some guidance from prominent
natural features, Tom more than once
allowed the airship to sink almost to the ground,
so that the Moor might scan the country.
</p>
<p>
On one of these occasions, about four hours
after they had left the yacht, Abdul said that
he recognized a hill stream whose source was
within a short distance of the sheikh’s stronghold.
From the directions he was now able to give,
Tom managed to steer fairly straight for the
tableland, and after once more descending so
that Abdul might assure himself that he had not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
been mistaken, he finally brought the airship to
rest at the desired spot. It was past three
o’clock in the morning; the sky was already
lightening with what Abdul called subhi kázib—the
false dawn which often in these latitudes
illumines the sky an hour or so before the real
dawn. The three adventurers were all very
tired, and on Abdul explaining that the tableland
was but rarely visited, and that so far as he knew
there were no wild beasts in the neighbourhood,
Tom thought that they might all safely take
a few hours’ sleep before considering the next
move. The tableland was not entirely flat;
it had many depressions, and jagged rocks stood
up on all sides around the comparatively clear
space on which the airship rested. Only one
hill, and that apparently four or five miles distant,
stood higher, and even the hawk-like vision of
the mountaineers was not likely to discover the
airship from so remote a spot.
</p>
<p>
The real dawn—subhi sadik—was some little
while past when the Moor awoke, first of the
three. He had just completed his morning
devotions and ablutions at a little spring when
the others roused themselves. Among the contents
of the car were a spirit lamp, a tin of
condensed milk, and materials for making tea;
and while they ate their breakfast Tom discussed with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
Oliphant the programme for the
day.
</p>
<p>
“The first thing is to find out exactly where
Ingleton is imprisoned,” said Tom, “and what
chance there is of getting into communication
with him. That’s a job for Abdul; obviously
we can’t help him; we can’t do better than lie
snug here while he goes and gets what information
he can.”
</p>
<p>
“A pretty dangerous job for him if he’s
caught, isn’t it?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, it’s a good many years since he left
these parts, and he must have altered. I doubt
whether he’ll be recognized. Luckily the hills
are covered with mist, too; if he starts soon
he’ll be able to get a good way before he’s likely
to run across any of his countrymen.”
</p>
<p>
“Or lose himself?”
</p>
<p>
“No, master,” said Abdul, “I don’t not
lose myself. I go all right.”
</p>
<p>
“The sooner the better, then,” said Tom.
“We’ll wait for you here.”
</p>
<p>
The Moor, who had resumed his native dress,
at once girt his djellab about him and prepared
to descend the hillside. Tom and Oliphant
watched him breathlessly until the mist hid him
from view. He went over the brow of the hill
and began to clamber down its steep side with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
the agility and sure-footedness of a mountain
goat. When he was out of sight the others
returned to their half-finished breakfast, ready
to endure with what patience they might the
long waiting until the Moor should have completed
his errand.
</p>
<p>
“What if he doesn’t come back?” said
Oliphant.
</p>
<p>
“We shall have to risk it ourselves. I’m
certainly not going back without making the
attempt now that we have come so far. It’s
pretty cold up here; I shall be glad when the
sun sucks up this mist.”
</p>
<p>
When the mist at last cleared away, a magnificent
view spread out before the two watchers
on the hill-top. They themselves were perched
on the top of a practically bare rock, but a hundred
feet below them the hill side was covered
with forest, broken, however, with huge patches of
rocky ground, on which apparently not even the
hardiest tree could find a lodgment. For miles
around, the country showed a succession of tree-clad
hills, with here and there a waterfall, and here
and there a bare summit, not, however, truncated
like the hill on which they had landed. Far
away to the north-west they could descry, through
their field-glasses, a considerable walled village
perched on the shoulder of a hill, with one or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
two large buildings, one presumably a mosque,
and a second evidently the stronghold of the
sheikh. This no doubt was the place in which
they were interested. It lay in the direction
generally indicated by the Moor, although when
he started it was hidden by the mists.
</p>
<p>
The hours dragged all too slowly by. They
talked over the situation, occasionally getting up
to stretch their limbs, but not venturing to move
about much, lest they should be seen by any
chance shepherd or hunter. On the plain below
they caught sight of animals moving, and longed
to take a shot at them—now a gazelle, now a
wild hog. But to fire a shot was out of the
question, and they had to content themselves
with exchanging reminiscences of sport at home.
</p>
<p>
Darkness fell again. Abdul had not returned.
Each spent a restless night, and rose with the
dawn, eagerly scanning the country, as soon as
the mist was dispersed, for a sign of their emissary,
but in vain.
</p>
<p>
“I hope he hasn’t been collared,” said Tom.
</p>
<p>
“Or turned traitor!”
</p>
<p>
“He wouldn’t do that, I’m sure. I like the
fellow. Of course you read a lot about oriental
duplicity, but I don’t believe Abdul is a rogue.
Anyway, we should have time to get away in
the airship before any one could molest us here,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
and he knows that. For the life of me I don’t
know what we can do if he <em>has</em> been collared.
We can’t do a thing until we know where Ingleton
is; we certainly can’t go inquiring ourselves.
All we can do is to go back to the yacht and
try and pick up some English-speaking native
who can tell us what we want to know, and that
means loss of time.”
</p>
<p>
“And more than that; it would mean that
I’d have to turn into M’Cracken again, and I
don’t believe I could keep up the disguise any
longer. I say, what’s that moving down there?”
</p>
<p>
They seized their field-glasses and turned
them towards a patch moving along the outskirts
of a wood some miles away.
</p>
<p>
“Moors, by Jove!” exclaimed Oliphant.
“And mounted. And coming this way. It looks
as though Abdul had betrayed us, after all.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be in a hurry. They’re making no
attempt to mask their approach. I don’t believe
they’re coming here at all. No; see, they are
wheeling off to the right, in the direction of the
hill village yonder. We needn’t worry ourselves.
But I’m getting sick of this, and it’ll be serious
soon. I only brought three days’ grub in the
car, and I’m afraid we ate more than we ought
yesterday. That’s the worst of having nothing
to do.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
</p>
<p>
“It’s so plaguy hot, too, when the sun’s up.
For two pins I’d go down and have a shot at
something in the woods. No doubt it’s cooler
down there, and there’s no fun in lying about up
here to frizzle.”
</p>
<p>
“There’d certainly be no fun in being pitched
into a Moorish dungeon. By all accounts they’re
rather horrible. I think I’d rather frizzle here
than stew there. In any case, even supposing
the Moors didn’t find out who was firing, the
shots would put them on their guard and perhaps
spoil our game. I say, Oliphant, reel off some
of your stories.”
</p>
<p>
But even Oliphant’s stories in the Doric
palled, and by and by Tom got up and said
that he was going for a stroll. He was away for
nearly an hour, and Oliphant began to feel uneasy
at his prolonged absence. Oliphant dared not
call, for fear of being overheard by an enemy;
nor did he care to explore. But he was making
up his mind to follow Tom down the steep path
when the wanderer at last returned.
</p>
<p>
“Rather interesting spot, this,” he said.
“Round the corner below there I came upon
some caves.”
</p>
<p>
“I wondered what had become of you. Did
you get lost?”
</p>
<p>
“No. The odd thing is that these caves are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
up about twenty feet from a ridge of rock, and
can’t be got at without a ladder. I tried to
mount, but the wall is almost flat.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go and have a look. How do you get
there?”
</p>
<p>
“Down the hill a little way, turn to the right,
go along the ridge, and look up. The caves are
about halfway between the ridge and the top of
the hill.”
</p>
<p>
Oliphant followed these directions, and by and
by returned, with his trousers cut in several
places.
</p>
<p>
“I tried to climb up,” he explained, “but
couldn’t manage it. I think it could be done,
though, with practice.”
</p>
<p>
“Which we haven’t time for.”
</p>
<p>
The discovery of the caves had occupied some
little time, and furnished material for speculation
and talk that helped to relieve the tedium of
waiting. But their patience had well nigh given
out when night once more descended and still
Abdul had not returned. The two were eating
their supper in moody silence when they heard
suddenly the sound of a stone rattling down the
hillside. They seized their revolvers and sprang
up, waiting for another sound. Clearly some
one, man or animal, was climbing the hill. All
was again silent; then, from some point beyond
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
them, came the sound of a high-pitched voice.
</p>
<p>
“It’s Abdul. Thank goodness!” cried
Oliphant, with a laugh. “Come on, you laggard,
and give an account of yourself.”
</p>
<p>
“You have been a long time, Abdul,” said
Tom, as that young Moor came through the
darkness.
</p>
<p>
“True, master; but it is with us a saying,
‘Every delay is good.’”
</p>
<p>
“Well, come and have something to eat.
You’re pretty tired and hungry, no doubt.
Then you can tell us what you have done.”
</p>
<p>
But Abdul declined the food offered him, and
producing a wallet from beneath his djellab,
displayed a heap of dates. He related that he
had made his way safely into the village, but as
he went through the street towards the house
of Hamet Ali—a friend on whose discretion he
could rely—he fancied from the manner of an
old water-carrier that the man had recognized
him. He contrived to slip away among a company
of muleteers that happened to be passing,
and reached his friend’s house unmolested; but
shortly afterwards he learnt from this friend that
the water-carrier had mentioned his suspicions,
and that inquiries were being diligently made
for him through the village. Every exit was
watched; and his friend was in some anxiety
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
lest an emissary of the sheikh should come and
search the house. Hamet, however, was an old
enemy of the sheikh, though, with true oriental
dissimulation, he had hitherto managed to hide
the fact. He agreed to give Abdul shelter so
long as it was safe to do so, but impressed upon
him that he must not venture to show himself out
of doors.
</p>
<p>
He then inquired what had brought Abdul
to the village, and the boy thought it advisable
to confide in him, taking care to heighten the
mystery of the wonderful ship that sailed through
the air, and to promise, on the Englishmen’s
behalf, liberal bakshish to Hamet if he lent all
possible assistance to the enterprise. He wished
his friend to send a messenger to Tom, but this
Hamet refused to do, for the results to himself,
if the messenger were followed and caught, might
be disastrous.
</p>
<p>
On the morning of the same day, when Hamet
returned from his usual visit to the sôk, he
reported that a camel-driver had arrived, bearing
a message from a Jew of Rabat, Salathiel ben
Ezra by name, who proposed to come in person
to see the sheikh, and had sent a swift rider in
advance to request a safe-conduct. The Jews
are tolerated, scorned, made to do menial work,
in the ports; in remote districts of Morocco
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
they carry their lives in their hands. But the
message conveyed to the sheikh had been such
that Salathiel’s request was granted, and a dozen
men had been sent on horseback towards the
coast as an escort. Hearing this, Abdul decided
that at all costs he must return to his employer.
Under cover of the night he had contrived to
slip away from the village, and had come back
by a circuitous route so as to make sure of not
being intercepted.
</p>
<p>
“But what of the prisoner?” asked Tom.
“Did you learn anything of him?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, master. He is in the sheikh’s kasbah.”
</p>
<p>
“What is kasbah?”
</p>
<p>
“Strong place, master; thick walls; a very
bad prison.”
</p>
<p>
“We are on the right track, Oliphant,” said
Tom.
</p>
<p>
“It looks bad, though. Ingleton will be
pretty well guarded, you may be sure; and I
don’t for the life of me see how we can break
into a strong place and get him out.”
</p>
<p>
“Unless we bribe his jailers. Could we get
him away with bakshish, Abdul?”
</p>
<p>
“No, master. The sheikh would cut hands
and feet off, put eyes out, and more.”
</p>
<p>
“Evidently we’ve got our work cut out,
Oliphant. And you may depend upon it our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
friend Salathiel has somehow found out our
errand and is coming to warn the sheikh. I
remember now that I saw him talking to one
of the Moors who came aboard the yacht.”
</p>
<p>
“That explains it.”
</p>
<p>
“How long will it take him to get here,
Abdul?”
</p>
<p>
“Two three days, master.”
</p>
<p>
“We must be beforehand with him, then.
Are you prepared for short rations, Oliphant?
Our grub won’t last more than another day.”
</p>
<p>
“Plenty dates and figs in woods, master,” said
Abdul.
</p>
<p>
“We shan’t starve, then. Let’s have a good
sleep, Oliphant. We shall want all our strength
for this job.”
</p>
<p>
“We shall indeed. Poor old pater! Wouldn’t
he have the blues if he knew where I am!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>CHAPTER VIII—THE SWORDSMITH OF AIN AFROO</h2>
<p>
The approaching advent of the Jew had
introduced a new element of danger into
the enterprise. If he should reach the village
before Ingleton was released, clearly the game
was up. Instead of getting a good sleep, Tom
lay awake, talking over the situation with Oliphant.
He got Abdul to describe the kasbah, but the
description was so vague—the Moor when he
lived in the village having taken the stronghold
for granted—that he felt incapable of making
any plans without seeing the place for himself.
When he made this suggestion Oliphant scouted
it.
</p>
<p>
“For one thing,” he said, “it’s too dangerous;
for another, where do I come in?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course I should have to take Abdul—or
rather he would have to take me; and however
dangerous it would be for two, it would be still
more dangerous for three. If you’ll stay and
keep an eye on the airship, I’ll take advantage of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
the moonlight and go and have a look round.
Your turn will come, you may be sure of that.
If I don’t come back, you know how to set the
machine going. Scoot back to the yacht, and
get Mr. Greatorex to make straight for Tangier.”
</p>
<p>
“There’ll be a pretty row about this before
we’ve done with it! All right!—if you <em>will</em> go.
But I say, they’ll spot you for a foreigner if
any one catches sight of you—in those clothes.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; I forgot that. I wish I’d provided
myself with a rig-out in the Moorish style.”
</p>
<p>
Here Abdul produced from the folds of his
djellab a small bundle, which, being unrolled,
proved to be a long grey garment with a pair of
yellow shoes wrapped in it.
</p>
<p>
“You’re a brick, Abdul!” cried Tom. “You
guessed I’d want something of this sort, eh?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, master. I could only get one.”
</p>
<p>
“So you’re out of it for the present, anyhow,
Oliphant. Well, good-bye. If we’re lucky we’ll
be back by the morning; if not—you know what
to do.”
</p>
<p>
Five minutes later Tom, swathed in the
djellab, disappeared over the brow of the hill
with Abdul. He carried his revolver; the Moor
had only a knife. In his unfamiliar garment
Tom found it by no means easy to make the
descent down the rough precipitous path; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
Abdul went first, picking the easiest course, and
both arrived safely at the bottom.
</p>
<p>
Then they began their march to the village.
It was a toilsome journey, and Tom found the
Moorish slippers a very inconvenient footgear.
A long tramp, and another steep climb, brought
them to the wall of the village, which was built
on the slope of the hill. The gates had been
shut at sunset, Abdul explained: that was the
Moorish fashion. Tom perceived that the wall
was utterly dilapidated: in that respect Ain
Afroo was typically Moorish. In many parts
the parapet had fallen to pieces, and, for any protection
it afforded, the wall might as well not have
been there. It gave easy foothold to a climber,
and Tom indulged a hope that the kasbah might
prove to be in equally bad preservation.
</p>
<p>
From what Abdul had told him, Tom guessed
that the stronghold lay at the upper extremity
of the village, about eighty or ninety yards from
the wall. The Moor’s knowledge of the place
enabled him to lead Tom to a spot where it would
clearly be an easy matter to climb the battlements.
Secure in their remoteness, and in the fact that
no hostile force could come within many miles
of the village without being instantly announced,
the inhabitants kept only a perfunctory watch.
A few men, Abdul said, were regularly on guard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
at the north-east and south-west corners; but
no attempt was made to watch the walls in
general. Knowing the state of the defences,
this fact gave Tom some amusement. With
walls so ruinous the gates were the last places
at which unauthorized ingress or egress would be
made. The whole place was still sleeping, and
would sleep until the muezzin from the mosque
gave the call to prayer. Abdul declared it was
quite safe to enter the village so far as its human
inhabitants were concerned, though there was
a risk that some pariah dog might be wakeful.
Taking his courage in both hands, Tom climbed
up the wall after Abdul, and descended on the
other side; then, keeping in the black shadows
cast by the moon, the two made their way through
round archways and narrow alleys to the outer
wall of the kasbah.
</p>
<p>
The village was very silent. It might almost
have been an abode of the dead. Only the
screech of night-birds beyond the walls broke
the stillness. Tom held his breath—and his
nose, for sanitary authorities are unknown in
Morocco, and heaps of refuse here and there
spoke forcibly in the night air. The two intruders
crept stealthily round the walls of the kasbah,
against which small shops and outbuildings that
Abdul called <em>inzella</em> were built, except before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
the principal entrance—a large gateway through
which two or three men could ride abreast. In
front of this gateway was a wide, open square,
with low shops under a colonnade on the other
side.
</p>
<p>
The gateway was shut. It had massive iron
doors. Stealing to the further side of it, Abdul
touched Tom’s arm, and pointed to a small
dark window, unglazed, scarcely more than a
slit in the wall, some twenty-five feet above their
heads, and a yard or two back from the parapet,
which, as the Moor had already explained,
extended right round the kasbah, enclosing a
kind of terrace. It was the window of the guest-chamber,
and there, Abdul had suggested, the
captured envoy was confined.
</p>
<p>
The entrance to the guest-chamber would be
from the terrace within the parapet. The floor
above was occupied by the sheikh and his family;
the floor below was devoted to the servants and
the guard. Even as Tom looked, a figure passed
slowly along the terrace, and the moonlight
glinted on a steel musket barrel. It was clear
that the guest-chamber was carefully guarded—a
proof, it seemed, that Abdul’s suggestion was
correct. Drawing Tom out of earshot, Abdul
said that special orders must have been given,
or the sentry would certainly not tramp up and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
down at this hour of night. Tom learnt afterwards
that the Moorish soldier’s idea of sentry-go
is a long nap in the nearest doorway.
</p>
<p>
“Is there no entrance to the guest-chamber
from within?” asked Tom.
</p>
<p>
Abdul confessed that he did not know. He
had never set foot within the walls. But he
had once taken refuge for the night, on one of
his journeys through the country, in a ruined
kasbah of somewhat similar appearance, and
there a door led from the guest-chamber into a
small vestibule, which gave access to the upper
floor and the roof above.
</p>
<p>
Flitting silently across the square, Tom and
the Moor took post under the shadow of the
colonnade on the farther side, which ran at right
angles to the wall of the kasbah. Within it was
a row of shops, now shut and barred. There,
leaning against one of the stout columns, within
the black darkness of the Moorish arch, Tom
scanned the kasbah, looming white in the moonlight,
and meditated.
</p>
<p>
To get into communication with the prisoner
seemed absolutely hopeless. No one could force
an entrance into the sheikh’s strong place. Was
it possible to gain the assistance of some one
within? Might not Hamet Ali, Abdul’s friend,
act as intermediary between Tom and some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
servant of the sheikh’s? The cynical saying,
“Every man has his price,” was literal truth in
Morocco: such was the impression Tom had
gained from his reading. But he knew enough
of oriental ways to be sure that the fixing of the
price would be a long and tedious affair. If the
Moor were asked to name it, he would suggest
a sum far in excess of what he would ultimately
accept; while however large a sum were offered,
it would prove only the starting place for long
haggling. Indeed, the larger the bribe, the
more likely it would be to excite the cupidity
of the agent, and to encourage him to stand out
for yet higher terms.
</p>
<p>
In spite of the difficulties, Tom would have
been inclined to attempt this means if it had not
involved serious delay, and still more serious
risk to both Abdul and himself. Hamet Ali
lived on the far side of the town. Abdul would
have to make his way there, waken his friend,
explain the circumstances, overcome a probable
reluctance to meddle, fix a price with Hamet
Ali, and another for the sheikh’s servant. Every
move would be attended with danger. A Moor’s
house is a castle in miniature. Any attempt to
rouse the inmates at this dead hour of night
would necessitate so much noise and clatter as
to disturb the neighbourhood. The night was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
wearing on, and before Abdul could, with reasonable
regard to secrecy, obtain access to his friend’s
house, daylight might be upon them. The
Moors are early risers, and even if all went well,
and Tom and the others stole forth from the
village before dawn, they would almost certainly
be seen and ridden down as they crossed the
wide rocky spaces that surrounded the place.
But the most serious consideration of all was
that of time: it would not be possible to get
into treaty with any one inside the kasbah before
Salathiel ben Ezra appeared on the scene. Then
the enterprise was doomed to failure.
</p>
<p>
Tom was anxiously discussing with himself
the pros and cons when Abdul plucked him by
the arm.
</p>
<p>
“Day is near, master,” he whispered. “We
must go by the way we came.”
</p>
<p>
Tom was reluctant to own himself beaten;
but there was clearly no hope for it. Gathering
his djellab about him, and pulling the hood over
his head, he followed Abdul with quick, noiseless
footsteps across the square.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
Ahmed Hûk, apprentice to Hamadi ben Ibn,
the swordsmith of Ain Afroo, had spent a
restless night. His head throbbed; he could not
sleep; he wished he had not smoked so much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
hashish when his work was done for the day.
The air of the little shop was close and oppressive;
and after hours of wakefulness, turning from side
to side in the vain effort to find sleep, Ahmed
got up and quietly unbarred the little wicket in
the door, careful not to disturb his master, who
was snoring loudly within a few feet of him.
Perhaps a little fresh air from the outside would
cool his heated brow.
</p>
<p>
He had not stood more than a few minutes
at the wicket, and was already thinking of returning
to his charpoy, when he noticed, in the moonlight
on the other side of the square, two figures
turn the corner by the kasbah opposite, coming
from the direction of the village wall. They
at once disappeared into the shadow thrown by
the great wall of the building, but something
in their movements aroused the curiosity of
Ahmed. Why were two wayfarers abroad at so
late an hour? The matter was not his concern;
still, he would remain at the wicket a little longer,
to see if the two night-walkers reappeared.
</p>
<p>
His view was somewhat broken by the rows of
pillars supporting the colonnade in front of the
shops of which his master’s establishment was
one; but through the interval between two of
them he did at last see the two forms moving
with rather suspicious quickness across the illumined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
square, and, what was more interesting to
him, they were seemingly coming in his direction.
Were they thieves, he wondered? He could
hardly believe it, for the village was small; they
could scarcely escape detection; and the sheikh’s
ingenuity in punishments was notorious even
in Morocco, where torture is a fine art.
</p>
<p>
With instinctive caution Ahmed closed the
wicket, leaving only a slit just wide enough for
him to peep through. In a few moments he
heard the slight rustle of the strangers’ garments,
and saw their dark forms clearly outlined against
the moonlight. They had come under the
colonnade and halted within two or three yards
of him, behind one of the pillars. They whispered
a little together, then were silent for a space,
then whispered again: and now Ahmed was
interested indeed, for, low as their tones were, he
overheard a word or two, and they made him
jump; they were certainly not in the Moorish
tongue. His master’s business had taken him
more than once to Dár al Beida, and he had heard
such words used by the N’zrani—the unbelievers
who were suffered to pollute the city by their
presence. How came it that here, in Ain Afroo,
a village where no unbeliever ever set foot save
a dog of a Jew now and then (though truly
there were one or two infidel wretches now safely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
confined in the kasbah)—how came it that two
men, good Moors and followers of the Prophet,
to all appearance, were speaking in the tongue of
the infidel? It was perplexing, to say the
least, and undoubtedly worthy of the attention
of Hamadi his master.
</p>
<p>
Leaving the wicket, Ahmed silently groped
his way to the charpoy on which the swordsmith
was sleeping, and gently awakened him. In a low
whisper he conveyed the news of his discovery.
Hamadi at once rose, and, trusting to the pitch
darkness of the colonnade, opened the wicket
fully, and listened with all his ears.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
Tom and Abdul had no sooner crossed the
square than the bolts of the shop door opposite
which they had been standing were softly drawn
back, and Hamadi, followed by his apprentice,
glided barefoot after them. Each bore a sword—good
weapons, as Hamadi, who had made them,
well knew. Hamadi saw a vision of great prosperity
and high favour with the sheikh. He
would follow up the strangers, if strangers they
indeed were, to the house where they harboured.
There he would leave Ahmed to keep watch, while
he himself sped to the kasbah and told what he
had seen. Without doubt the sheikh would
reward him handsomely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
</p>
<p>
By the time Hamadi and his boy had left the
shelter of the colonnade, the strangers had turned
the corner of the far side of the square; but the
pursuers ran quickly across the open space and
gained the corner while their quarry was still in
sight.
</p>
<p>
Tom and his companion, picking their way with
all caution through the dark, uneven, dirty
passages that led from the kasbah to the outer
wall, went out slowly. Every now and again
they stumbled over a loose cobble or a heap of
refuse; then there was a little noise that might
betray their presence to any one who happened
to be within a few yards of them. At
such times Abdul would throw a hurried glance
back; well he knew what their fate would be
if they were captured.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly he edged a little closer to Tom and
whispered—
</p>
<p>
“Men follow us!”
</p>
<p>
By this time they were almost within reach
of the wall. Tom was alive to the danger in
which the pursuit had placed them. Descending
the wall, they would have to grope for foothold.
Before they could get clear, the pursuers would
have come up behind, and might either topple
down upon them loose boulders from the wall,
or, if they bore firearms, have them at their
mercy. The two hurried their steps.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
</p>
<p>
“They are close behind—two men!” whispered
Abdul.
</p>
<p>
Tom glanced to each side along the wall.
There was no convenient place in which they
might take refuge with any prospect of eluding
their pursuers. They were now hasting along
at a half run beneath a long wall that possibly
enclosed some gardens of houses backing on the
ramparts. Here and there this wall was broken
by a doorway; but the gates, when Tom tested
them by a push, were always closed. Abdul was
making for the spot at which they had entered
the village; it was the nearest, indeed the only
practicable, place of descent. But to descend,
with the pursuers upon them, would be dangerous,
perhaps fatal. To leave this place of exit, and
move farther along the ramparts or back into the
village, would be almost equally dangerous and
would lose precious time. The only other
course open to them was to tackle the problem
of disposing of the pursuers. Tom nervously
fingered his revolver; but a shot would rouse
the whole village and multiply the pursuers
perhaps fiftyfold.
</p>
<p>
While Tom was feverishly attempting to hit
on some means of dealing with the two men,
these, unaware that they had been seen, were
already reckoning up the profits of a successful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
coup. As soon as Hamadi the swordsmith
saw that the men in front were making for the
ramparts, he guessed at once that they were
intruders from the outside, and he also guessed
the point at which the exit was to be made.
This was not the first time that the place had
been used as a means of getting in and out of the
village by night. More than once it had happened
that the villagers, at feud with neighbouring
mountaineers, had crept out at night to settle
their scores, returning safely within the walls
before daybreak. The fact that the gates were
closed and no one could pass during the night
was prima facie evidence of their innocence. It
was even said that the sheikh had settled accounts
with a hostile neighbour in the same way. The
swordsmith therefore was quite justified in
shaping his course on the assumption that the
two men in front of him would climb down the
ruined part of the wall, and he would be in
ample time to deal with them when they were
clinging precariously to the face of the stonework.
</p>
<p>
The only fault in his calculation was that he
did not reckon with the sharp eyes of Tom’s
companion. Thus it was that, passing incautiously
one of the recessed doorways leading on
to the gardens, he suddenly saw a thousand
brilliant lights flash before his eyes, his sword
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
flew from his grasp, and he reeled dizzily to the
ground. Tom’s muscles were hardened by much
exercise in engineering workshops, and Hamadi,
though a big man and strong, as befitted one of
his trade, was not prepared for so surprising an
attack. Before he could recover his wits Tom
was upon him, pressing the cold barrel of his
revolver to his ear. The man, although dizzy,
had still enough intelligence left to know what
this meant, and he lay quite still while Tom
pondered how he could at the same time secure
his vanquished foe and lend assistance to his
companion, who was now hotly engaged with
the apprentice. Abdul, however, needed no
help. Before Tom had time to decide upon his
own course, the young Moor, taking full advantage
of the darkness that neutralized the effect of his
enemy’s longer weapon, dodged in beneath the
latter’s guard, and got home a shrewd thrust
in the forearm. Ahmed, yelling lustily, dropped
his sword, spun round, and set off down the
ramparts at full speed before Abdul could repeat
his stroke.

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span></div>
<p>
Tom breathed more freely. He had at any
rate, he thought, gained a few minutes. The
yells of the Moor were not likely to bring help
immediately. While a shot would undoubtedly
have raised the guard at the kasbah, and brought
a party in hot haste to the spot, the cries of a
man yelling would probably only cause a certain
sleepy curiosity. A Moor never puts himself to
unnecessary trouble, and it would certainly not
be worth while to pay much attention to a brawl
between men who had smoked too much hashish.
But there was still need for haste, so with Abdul’s
assistance Tom trussed up the fallen swordsmith
with workmanlike bonds made of his own garments,
and in another minute was beginning the
descent of the wall.
</p>
<p>
They were only halfway down when they
heard an uproar in the village. The apprentice
had lost no time in gathering a band to continue
the pursuit. Yet Tom could not hurry his
flight, for a false step would mean at least a
broken arm, and in all probability a broken neck.
With Abdul close behind he picked his way down
the broken masonry, the shouts growing ever
nearer and more menacing. At last they reached
the bottom. Then, Abdul leading the way,
they hurried along the foot of the wall. They
durst not yet leave its shelter, for the moon,
though now sinking in the sky, still threw sufficient
light to betray them if they attempted to cross
the open space towards the hillside.
</p>
<p>
Crouching low as they went, they heard the
pursuers halt at the place where they had descended.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
But now they had reached a welcome
patch of stunted bush which promised needful
cover. Plunging into this, still keeping low
so that their heads should not show above the
scrub, they strode away at right angles to the
wall. Abdul’s knowledge of the country served
him well. Descending the hill, they were soon
out of danger. Then up and down little
eminences, over brooks, through patches of wood,
they pressed on, always bearing slightly to
the right until they struck the true course.
Almost in a bee-line, they made for the hill
where Oliphant was anxiously awaiting them, and
arrived there just after dawn, tired out, and not
a little disappointed with the barren result of
their night’s work.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX—A BOLT FROM THE BLUE</h2>
<p>
“Thank Heaven you are back!” said
Oliphant when Tom appeared over
the brow of the hill. “I don’t think I ever
spent a more miserable night.”
</p>
<p>
“Anything happened?”
</p>
<p>
“No. It wouldn’t have been so bad if anything
had. If I’d had something to do—somebody
to fight, or something!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you could have gone to sleep.”
</p>
<p>
“So I did, and woke in a fright. I dreamt
that wretched Jew fellow was coming at me
with outstretched hands, and his fingernails
were like some horrid bird’s claws, and he grew
bigger and bigger as he came until he seemed
as huge as a mountain. But what luck did you
have?”
</p>
<p>
“None, or next to none. The kasbah’s as
strong as Newgate. And the worst of it is, we
were spotted and followed, had to truss up
one fellow; another alarmed the village. We
escaped just by the skin of our teeth.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
</p>
<p>
He related in detail the incidents of the night.
</p>
<p>
“It looks as if we’ll have to back out after all,”
said Oliphant gloomily when the story was
finished.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be hanged if we will. I’ve been thinking
it over, and talking it over with Abdul, on
the way back. The only chance, it seems to
me, is to face all the risks and make a dash for
it.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“Come down in the airship on the terraced
roof of the kasbah under cover of night, and
trust to luck to find our way to the prisoners’
quarters.”
</p>
<p>
“But that would be confoundedly risky,
especially after you have once given the alarm in
the village.”
</p>
<p>
“I admit that’s a nuisance, but it’s perhaps
not so bad as you think. You see, the Moors
know nothing—I hope they don’t, at any rate—about
the airship, and they won’t look for intruders
from the sky. The botheration is that we’ve
lost a lot of time, and our chance is utterly
dished if the Jew gets in first. Abdul says he
can’t be more than a day’s march from the place
now. That’s about thirty miles, as near as I
can make out. Luckily it’s very rough country,
so that he can’t come fast. He’s probably starting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
this very morning for his last stage; it’s
possible that we’ve already lost our chance, for
he’s sure to hurry, and if he gets the ear of the
sheikh before nightfall, they’ll be on the watch
for us.”
</p>
<p>
“But even without the Jew I don’t see how
your scheme’s possible. There are sure to be
extra guards at the wall, and if the night were
as bright as this they couldn’t help seeing the
machine, and we couldn’t alight without their
knowledge.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; but you must allow for their ignorance
and superstition. If they do see the airship
swooping down on them they’ll be scared out of
their wits; they’ll think it some monstrous evil
bird straight from Gehenna——”
</p>
<p>
“Which is down below, not up aloft.”
</p>
<p>
“They won’t be in a state to draw distinctions
of that sort. Abdul assures me that these ignorant
mountaineers—he was one himself once,
but travel has widened his mind!—will be in
such a state of terror that they’ll be for a time
pretty well paralysed: and time’s all we want.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, he ought to know his countrymen.
But there’s the Jew: suppose he <em>does</em> get there
first?”
</p>
<p>
“We’ve got to prevent him.”
</p>
<p>
“What!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
</p>
<p>
“As I say, we must go and intercept him.”
</p>
<p>
“But he won’t come alone.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course not. Abdul says he will come
on horseback with a band of armed and mounted
men. He wouldn’t trust himself in this country
without an escort. But that’s where the airship
comes in. I rather fancy that if we swoop down
from the sky among a lot of Moors they’ll think
more of their own safety than of the Jew’s.”
</p>
<p>
“Still, we couldn’t prevent them from going
on to the village.”
</p>
<p>
“I think we could.”
</p>
<p>
“What! shoot ’em down?”
</p>
<p>
“No. I don’t want to hurt a hair of their
heads if I can help it. I think we can manage
to chase them back along the way they came,
and do something to frighten them into the
bargain. Do you know how to make throw-downs?”
</p>
<p>
“Never heard of ’em. What are they?”
</p>
<p>
“I forgot; you Eton fellows never use such
things, I suppose. Well, I’ll make some, and
you’ll confess they’re excellent little harmless
bombs. Then we’ll be off.”
</p>
<p>
Carefully opening two or three cartridge cases,
he extracted the powder, and screwing it up
with some tiny pebbles in tissue paper from his
pocket-book, he manufactured a dozen or so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
of the little bombs. Then he inspected the
machinery of the airship, thoroughly oiled the
parts, and went aboard with Oliphant and Abdul.
He allowed the machine to rise only a few feet
from the top of the hill, so as to avoid if possible
observation from the village; then he set off in
a south-easterly direction, keeping the hill between
him and the kasbah. Fetching a long circuit,
he gradually bore south-west, then slightly
north, until, in the course of about three-quarters
of an hour, he struck the narrow winding track
which would be followed by parties travelling
between the village and the coast.
</p>
<p>
From their elevated position they could trace
the path for a considerable distance through
the country, but as yet they had seen no sign
of a party approaching the village. In broad
daylight the airship must have been sighted by
many people over whose heads it had passed;
but from what Abdul had said it was unlikely
that any one would have the least idea of the
real nature of the apparition. They would
regard it as a supernatural creature, and if within
the next few hours a rumour of its appearance
should be carried to the sheikh of Ain Afroo
he would probably be none the wiser from any
description that might be attempted.
</p>
<p>
It was now little more than nine o’clock in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
the morning, and the Jew could scarcely have
passed. Tom therefore headed the airship
westward, keeping it at a low speed so that he
might carefully scan the country and not let the
Jew and his party escape him. He knew that,
unless accident signally befriended him, the
airship must be seen by them long before they
came into sight. Although the country was
spread out like a map, the machine in the
open sky must be a much more conspicuous
object to people below than they would be to
observers above. Salathiel would, of course,
recognize the airship; but Tom hoped that
before the man could explain clearly to his escort
what it was, the immediate object of the aerial
flight would have been achieved.
</p>
<p>
The morning wore away, and Tom began to
feel anxious. To keep the airship so long in
motion involved the expenditure of a large
amount of his propulsive paste, and he had
brought only as much of it as would last
the voyage to and from the hill fortress, with
a little margin for accidents. Yet he did not
care to bring the machine to rest, for he might
then miss the party of which he was in search.
Moreover, all the provisions were gone except
a few biscuits and some tea. With no food for
themselves and no fuel for the machine their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
plight would be desperate. Tom spoke of his
anxieties to Oliphant, and they were still talking
somewhat disconsolately, when Abdul, who
had never ceased to keep a sharp lookout,
suddenly cried “Horses!” and pointed to sundry
small specks ahead.
</p>
<p>
Tom instantly started up and looked through
his binocular in the direction of the Moor’s
forefinger.
</p>
<p>
“There are about a score, I fancy,” he said,
handing the glass to Oliphant. “Can you spot
the Jew?”
</p>
<p>
“No, they are too much mixed up. I
shouldn’t know him again, either.”
</p>
<p>
“We shall know him very soon, though.
Abdul told me that Jews in this country mostly
wear blue clothes and black skullcaps. We’ll
make straight for them.”
</p>
<p>
The engines had lately been reduced to something
less than half speed. Realizing that every
second was now of value, Tom put them at
full speed, steering the vessel direct for the
party of horsemen, who had just emerged from
a clump of timber. At the same time Oliphant
altered the inclination of the planes, so that
the airship began to drop rapidly earthwards.
Thus it swooped down upon the party like a huge
falcon. To manipulate the engines, the steering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
gear, and the lever affecting the planes, kept the
hands of Tom and his friend pretty fully occupied;
but Abdul was to make himself useful, and Tom
instructed him to take a handful of the little
bombs, in readiness to use them when the moment
came. Tom hoped that the mere appearance of
the sky monster would startle the horses and
put the cavalcade to fright. As an additional
means of scaring them he relied on the throwdowns.
</p>
<p>
The airship had come within about two miles
of the horsemen when it was seen that they had
halted. No doubt the strange apparition had
been observed, and Salathiel ben Ezra was doing
his best to explain its nature. They remained
stationary until the distance of the airship from
them was less than a mile: then two of them
wheeled suddenly in their tracks and set off in a
mad gallop westward. The others, however, held
their ground; either they had stronger nerves,
or the Jew had managed to convince them that
the strange object was not an instrument of the
Evil One, but simply a new invention of the
accursed people who had invented warships
and alarm clocks.
</p>
<p>
Tom had just distinguished the figure of
Salathiel, on a mule in the midst of the party,
when there came a slight puff of smoke from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
centre of the group, followed by a second and
a third. Oliphant laughed.
</p>
<p>
“They’re firing at us,” he exclaimed, “which
argues a pretty state of fright.”
</p>
<p>
“All very much in our favour. Look, there
are three more of them off as hard as they
can go.”
</p>
<p>
“But there are still ten or a dozen of them.
If they have nerve enough to hold their fire till
we come within range they may do us some damage—if
their guns are any good.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s not much doubt about that. They
get hold of good rifles somehow. But we’re in
for it now. A bullet or two in the machinery
would bring us to the ground; we must simply
take our chance.”
</p>
<p>
The airship was now approaching the party
at the speed of a fast train. Moment by moment
others of the horsemen detached themselves
from the group and galloped after their comrades,
and Tom gave a cry when he saw that the Jew
was among the fugitives. Still several remained.
</p>
<p>
“It won’t do to allow them to get between
us and the kasbah,” said Tom. “We must
drive the whole lot of them back towards the
coast.”
</p>
<p>
The airship was now only some three hundred
feet above the ground. Suddenly Tom shut
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
off the horizontal propellers and brought the
vertical engines into play. The airship swept
onward at the same level by virtue of its
momentum. The horses of the Moors began to
rear and plunge. They had probably heard
the whirr of the machinery, for not being long-sighted
beasts it was possible that they had not
yet seen the vessel above them.
</p>
<p>
“By George! aren’t they magnificent horsemen!”
said Oliphant, as he saw the Moors
striving to hold their terrified animals in. One
or two puffs, followed immediately by the
reports of the rifles, came from the group; but
with their horses rearing and plunging beneath
them it was not surprising that the Moors
missed the airship, though it now offered a considerable
mark. It was immediately above them.
</p>
<p>
“Now, Abdul!” said Tom.
</p>
<p>
The Moor flung one of the little bombs earthward
with all his force. It exploded at the very
feet of one of the horses, which, frenzied with
fear, took the bit between its teeth and bolted.
Abdul threw half a dozen more, one after
another, laughing with glee at the astonishing
effect of the little bombs. There was no
holding the horses any longer, and the whole
party dashed away at a mad gallop along the
road they had come.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
</p>
<p>
It was not Tom’s object to overtake them
yet awhile. He put the horizontal engines at
half speed, and the airship began to follow the
fugitives like a sheepdog at the heels of a frantic
flock. The little group which had stood to the
last were evidently the best mounted of the party,
for they gradually closed in upon those who had
started earlier. Tom could not forbear chuckling
as he came upon the rotund black-capped figure
of Salathiel ben Ezra striving to urge his steady-going
mule to a brisker pace.
</p>
<p>
“Is it safe to leave him behind?” asked
Oliphant, as the Jew was outstripped and
passed.
</p>
<p>
“Oh yes! We’ll come back for him presently.
We could easily catch him up. If the mule is
like most of his kind he won’t hurry himself.”
</p>
<p>
The airship sped on after the rest of the party.
Mile after mile was covered: the horses showed
signs of fatigue, but one or two that were dropping
behind were galvanized into further desperate
efforts by the dreaded whirr of the propellers
just in their rear.
</p>
<p>
The chase had continued for about half an
hour when Abdul suddenly noticed that the
number of the fugitives was one less than it had
been when the flight began. None of the three
occupants of the airship had seen a rider diverge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
from the track: to do so would indeed have
been difficult, for it ran through uneven and
rocky ground which offered little footway for a
horse. Yet it was clear that one of the Moors
had at some point or other left his comrades
and ridden off to right or left.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind,” said Tom. “If he tries to
get to the village, I’ve no doubt we can overtake
him. His horse will be no match for us.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you think we’ve chased them far
enough!” asked Oliphant. “We’re using up a
great deal of your paste.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I think we’ve pretty well disposed
of them now. We’ll swing round and go back
for Master Salathiel.”
</p>
<p>
“What are you going to do with him—not
bring him up here?”
</p>
<p>
“Not a bit of it. We don’t want him—not
for long, at least. I’ve got an idea. But we
must get hold of him first.”
</p>
<p>
Bringing the airship about in a wide circle,
Tom steered it back along the track in search of
the Jew.
</p>
<p>
“The donkey!” cried Oliphant, as presently
the man came in sight, making desperate efforts
to gain the village. “He might have hidden
himself among the rocks or the trees, and given
us no end of trouble.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know. He has chosen probably the
lesser of two evils. He’d have a bad time of it
if he were found alone by any wandering Moors;
his best chance was certainly to try to get to the
village and tell the sheikh all he knows.”
</p>
<p>
The Jew could be seen every now and again
glancing anxiously back along the track. When
he caught side of the airship returning, and
realized that he was bound to be overtaken, he
pulled up his mule, tumbled off the saddle, and
dived into the cover of some rocks, hoping no
doubt that they would afford him concealment.
</p>
<p>
“Too late!” said Tom with a chuckle.
“He might escape us if we were on his level,
but he forgets we can look right down upon
him.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s like a field-mouse trying to escape from
a hawk,” said Oliphant.
</p>
<p>
“Rather worse, for a field-mouse has its colour
to help it, while Salathiel’s blue coat makes
him a little too conspicuous.”
</p>
<p>
For a few moments the Jew, indeed, disappeared
from view; but Tom steered the airship
exactly above the spot where he was last seen,
and there was Salathiel crouching in a cleft
much too narrow for him.
</p>
<p>
There was no convenient landing-place among
the rocks where the airship could be brought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
safely to rest, and the Jew, apparently recognizing
this, did not attempt to stir from his position.
But the vessel came to rest in the air, hovering
like a monstrous humming-bird above the trembling
man, no more than twenty feet from the
ground.
</p>
<p>
“How shall we get at him?” asked Oliphant.
</p>
<p>
“We can leave that to Abdul, I think,” replied
Tom. “He is used to ship-board, and he has
been on the end of our rope before.”
</p>
<p>
Abdul understood what was required of him.
Letting down the rope with the grapnel at the
end, he swarmed nimbly down, armed only with
his knife. The two in the car smiled to see what
ensued. Salathiel was unarmed. He broke forth
in a torrent of mingled threats and entreaties
as the Moor approached him, then lay on his
back and tried to repel the lad with his feet.
But Abdul got behind him, and by discreet
employment of the point of his knife at length
persuaded the Jew into the open.
</p>
<p>
Then Tom let the airship gently down. When
it stood upon terra firma, he and Oliphant
leapt out of the car, bundled Salathiel into it, and
in another minute were soaring through the air
towards their former resting-place on the hill.
With Salathiel’s added weight the airship travelled
somewhat slowly, and for some time, when a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
breeze rose from the eastward, it had considerable
difficulty in making headway at all. But at last
the flat-topped hill was opened up on the horizon,
Tom estimating that the return journey had
taken more than twice as long as the outward
trip in the morning.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X—THE KASBAH</h2>
<p>
Instead of alighting on the former spot
on the top of the hill, Tom this time let
the airship down at the foot.
</p>
<p>
“We haven’t darkness to cover us this time,”
he said, “and we don’t want to be spied from
the village.”
</p>
<p>
“What are you going to do with our fat
friend?” asked Oliphant.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I thought of taking him some miles
into the wilder parts of the hills and leaving
him; but I don’t want to use any more of our
fuel than I can help. Besides, I don’t want to
have the fellow murdered, though his Moor
friend might have done for poor Timothy.
What do you say to giving him a lodging in one
of the caves?”
</p>
<p>
“But how in the world could we get him up
there?”
</p>
<p>
“Abdul says it can be done. I forgot to tell
you that on our way to Ain Afroo that night I
told Abdul of our discovery, and he said he knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
the caves well, and had often climbed into them.
The tradition of the country is that they were
actually cut in the rocks ages ago as a refuge when
the people were pressed by their enemies.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, it’s a capital idea if it can be managed.
The Jew would be out of harm’s way, at any
rate.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. And if we succeed in releasing Ingleton,
we can come back for him, perhaps, and take
him into Rabat or Casa Blanca, and make him
disgorge some of Abdul’s property, which I’ve no
doubt he has appropriated.”
</p>
<p>
“But won’t he starve? We can’t spare him
any food.”
</p>
<p>
“A day’s fasting won’t hurt him. We’re on
uncommonly short rations ourselves, and there’s
no reason why he should fare better than we.”
</p>
<p>
“But can we get him up? He’s a big fellow,”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll do our best with Abdul’s help. One
of the caves is more easy to get at than the others,
Abdul says.”
</p>
<p>
“By Jove, we’ve forgotten that fellow who
got away!”
</p>
<p>
“Hang it, so we have. It can’t be helped.
We clearly can’t catch him now without showing
ourselves to the people of Ain Afroo. Perhaps
he didn’t make for the village after all. We must
dispose of Salathiel, at any rate.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
</p>
<p>
Tom and Oliphant had been talking apart,
while Abdul kept watch over the Jew. The
former now went up to the man.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Salathiel,” he said. “I don’t exactly
know what your game is, but we think it’s
advisable you should have a little rest after your
arduous work with the mule. There’s a very
comfortable cave some eighty feet above your
head. The way to it is rather steep, but with
our assistance you can mount there, and remain
in perfect safety until we can fetch you and
restore you to your friends.”
</p>
<p>
“I protest you treat me badly,” said Salathiel,
his mien expressing mingled fear and indignation.
“I am a peaceable merchant, and was on my way
to treat with the sheikh of Ain Afroo for a supply
of carpets from Rabat, when——”
</p>
<p>
“Still, you must be fatigued,” said Tom.
“We also have business with the sheikh, and I
fear that until ours is completed yours must
wait. Ours is a prior engagement, Mr. Salathiel.
Now if you will please climb the hillside. The
first steps are easy; we will help you when you
find further ascent difficult.”
</p>
<p>
For some moments the Jew tried entreaty,
cajolery, even bribery—in vain. With a very
bad grace he began to clamber up the rocks,
reaching at length a ledge some twenty-five feet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
below the cave. The hill was here almost perpendicular,
and when Salathiel looked at the
wall of rock above him he pleaded again with
great volubility to be allowed to go his way.
But Abdul was already swarming up with a rope
between his teeth. The Englishmen watched
him with admiration. Sticking fingers and toes
into the slightest crevice, taking advantage of
every little irregularity in the surface, he accomplished
what had seemed from below an impossible
feat. When he reached the cave, he
tied one end of the rope to a spur of rock at
the entrance, and let down the other to Oliphant,
who by its assistance managed to follow. Salathiel
for a time absolutely refused to mount;
but when Tom pointed out that in the cave he
would at least be safe, while no one could answer
for what might happen if he wandered about
the country alone, he at length allowed the rope
to be wound about him, and was hauled up by
the two above. He was supplied with a pot of
water from the hill stream and a half-dozen
biscuits, then Oliphant descended, followed by
Abdul with the rope.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think he’ll attempt the descent,”
said Tom. “It requires more nerve than I
fancy he’s got.”
</p>
<p>
“It doesn’t matter much if he does, does it?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
He won’t try it while we are hereabout. He’ll
hardly try it in the dark when we are gone; and
if he does, and gets safely to the bottom, he’ll
take so long finding his way to the village that
we shall have done our business there—if we’re
going to do it at all.”
</p>
<p>
“Still, I think we’ll make sure. There are
one or two bits of rock sticking out that give
a slight foothold; Abdul may as well knock them
off. He won’t want them himself when we come
back to release the Jew.”
</p>
<p>
“Suppose we don’t come back!”
</p>
<p>
“You mean, suppose we come to grief ourselves!
Well, he’ll be able to signal for help
from the mouth of the cave to-morrow; some
of his cronies are sure to wonder what’s become
of him and be prowling about. It won’t matter
to us then, for we shall have either succeeded or
failed.”
</p>
<p>
“Suppose we can’t come back, and nobody
sees his signals!”
</p>
<p>
“That’s his lookout! Didn’t we rescue him
from the shark, which would have snapped
him up when the tide rose another few inches?
How has he repaid us? By trying to do for
us. And it isn’t as if he were a Moor, serving
his country. He hasn’t an ounce of patriotism
in his composition. He’s simply on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
make. He wanted to get a good haul out of the
sheikh for giving us away, and upon my word,
considering all things, I think he gets off pretty
easily. If he’d treated Moors as he has treated
us, he’d be dying a particularly slow death by this
time. I don’t think we need distress ourselves
about Salathiel ben Ezra.”
</p>
<p>
Leaving the Jew to his solitary reflections, the
two made their way back to the airship and
began to overhaul the machinery. Meanwhile
Abdul had gone to the summit of the hill to
bring down one or two things which had been
left there. He returned with the news that he
had seen in the far distance a single horseman
slowly climbing the steep hill-path to the village.
</p>
<p>
“That’s our man, depend upon it,” said
Oliphant. “He’ll give us away, Dorrell, as
sure as fate.”
</p>
<p>
“What can’t be cured must be endured. We
could catch him, I dare say; but we haven’t any
too much fodder for the engine, and we should
certainly be seen. He must tell the sheikh all he
knows, and, upon my word, I should like to hear
his account of us. It would probably be very
funny.”
</p>
<p>
“But it will put the sheikh on his guard.”
</p>
<p>
“My dear fellow, you haven’t enough faith
in the terrors of the unknown, or the misknown.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
The Moor’s story will be such a mass of exaggeration,
ignorance, and superstition, that they’ll be
in a state of jumps, and dread the apparition ten
times more even than if it came upon them
without preparation.”
</p>
<p>
“Then why go to the trouble of preventing
the Jew from getting into the village?”
</p>
<p>
“Just because he <em>knows</em> the thing, you see, and
would stick to the bare truth. His story would
lay more stress on the object of our visit; the
Moor’s will be mainly about the airship. Really,
he may help us in the end.”
</p>
<p>
They spent the afternoon in a thorough cleaning
of the engines. Once or twice Salathiel
showed himself at the mouth of the cave, and
Tom fancied he saw him attempt to signal with
his hands. But when Oliphant made a movement
towards his carbine, the Jew retreated
hastily into the interior and appeared no more.
</p>
<p>
At last all was ready for the voyage. But
several hours must yet pass before the ascent
could be made. Tom had decided that it would
be unwise to arrive at the kasbah until the
Moors were either in their first sleep, or, if on
their guard, were somewhat tired and nervous
with watching. Learning this, Abdul, who had
been making observations during the afternoon,
left the two Englishmen and was not seen for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
time. When he returned, he carried a couple
of hares, explaining that he had snared them in
the wood that lay half a mile beyond their resting-place.
He produced also from the folds of his
garment a number of figs and dates which he
had plucked from the trees.
</p>
<p>
“Here’s a tuck-in!” cried Tom. “I’m as
hungry as a hunter. Oatmeal biscuits are all
very well, but they’re a trifle too chippy for my
taste. I suppose you, as a Scotsman, think ’em
quite succulent, Oliphant?”
</p>
<p>
“Do I, by George? You Englishmen make
a good many mistakes about us Scots, and that’s
one of them. Besides, I’m only Scotch when I
want a stoker’s place—or when I let off some of
my stories on the fellows in Booker’s. I was
rather had once, though. When I first went to
Tabor’s as a little chap, on my first day I dropped
my cap somewhere, and asked one of the masters
if he’d seen it. I’d just come from our village
school up north—a whim of the governor’s, you
know—and I suppose I’d a touch of the brogue,
for when I said, ‘Please, sir, have you seen my
cap?’ he said quite pat, ‘Are <em>you</em> MacFarlane?’
And he called me MacFarlane until I left.”
</p>
<p>
Abdul had chosen a sheltered hollow, and built
a rough canopy of branches and leaves. Beneath
this he kindled a fire, and cooked one of the hares
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
The table appointments were not exactly those
that either of the lads was accustomed to, but,
as Oliphant remarked, they were in a primitive
country, and it was not unfitting that they should
resort to the manners of their ancestors. Both
confessed that they had never enjoyed a meal so
much as this, and felt all the more ready for the
adventures of the night.
</p>
<p>
The moon was shedding a cold radiance around,
in strange contrast with the hot and sultry air,
when the airship with its three passengers rose
from the foot of the hill and started on its voyage
for the kasbah of Ain Afroo. To lessen the
chances of premature discovery, Tom ascended
to a considerable altitude, with the intention of
dropping obliquely upon the kasbah. He was
thus able to dispense in great part with the action
of the propellers as the airship drew near to its
destination, which was very desirable, seeing
that they made a loud whirring which must
otherwise have attracted attention. But by
ascending to a height of nearly 3,000 feet, and
then adjusting the planes so that the airship fell
at a sharp angle, he could make use of the force
of gravity to carry him in the right direction
without employing the horizontal screws. Finding,
however, when half the distance had been
covered, that the airship was coming too near
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
the ground, he set the vertical screws in motion
rose a few hundred feet, and again dropped
obliquely towards his objective.
</p>
<p>
The whole country was bathed in the moon’s
pale light, and lay in perfect silence save for the
faint barking of dogs here and there. The three
adventurers said never a word; neither Tom
nor Oliphant was in a mood for talking now that
the real business of the expedition was so near at
hand. It was not until the airship was hovering
exactly over the flat roof of the kasbah that they
knew, from shouts below, that the strange visitant
had been observed. But some moments must
elapse, presumably, before the alarm could penetrate
to the sheikh’s apartments; and, aware
that everything depended on his coolness and
caution, Tom brought the airship to rest with as
much deliberation as if he were landing from a
practice voyage.
</p>
<p>
A shot from a musket struck one of the planes.
</p>
<p>
“The sentry on the terrace has caught sight
of us,” said Tom, as he was stepping out of the
car. “Let us hope that after having done his
duty he’ll be sufficiently scared to bolt for the
town, instead of coming up to warn the
sheikh.”
</p>
<p>
The programme had been settled before they
started. Oliphant was to remain in charge of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
the airship, while Tom and the Moor attempted
to get into the house and release the prisoner.
</p>
<p>
“Remain in the car,” said Tom, “and have
everything ready to ascend at a moment’s notice.”
</p>
<p>
“Wish you good luck, old fellow,” returned
Oliphant. “You’ve got your revolver?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. <em>Au revoir!</em>”
</p>
<p>
He glanced anxiously round for the opening
that led from the roof into the house. In the
ordinary way it would not be closed; indeed,
during the summer months, except when rain
threatened, such openings were seldom covered.
Unless the fugitive had the gift of second sight,
it was improbable that he would ever have
imagined that the airship would descend on the
very roof of the sheikh’s own dwelling. Thus
the inmates would have no reason to guard
against intrusion from above. Things might
have been different in a populous town, where
access could be had from one roof to another.
But the kasbah stood quite solitary, and the
nearest buildings were inaccessible.
</p>
<p>
The opening, in point of fact, lay within a few
feet of the spot upon which the airship had
descended.
</p>
<p>
Carrying an electric torch in one hand and
his revolver in the other, Tom stepped gingerly
down the staircase, followed by the Moor, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
held his knife ready for instant use. They came
across a small vestibule, lit at the far end by the
moonlight streaming through a narrow aperture
in the wall. To the right and left was a door;
one led no doubt to the sheikh’s harem, the other
probably to the apartments of the male members
of the family; but Abdul was unable to say
which was which. There were no bolts on the
outside of these doors, which were fast shut, but
each had a very large keyhole.
</p>
<p>
Inasmuch as the entry to this part of the house
was no doubt barred beneath by a door on the
staircase, it was quite possible that the inhabitants
felt themselves secure enough to dispense
with locking these doors. Certainly a Moor will
never take any trouble if he can avoid it.
</p>
<p>
Choosing the right-hand door, Tom gently
turned the handle; the door opened to his push,
and, inserting his hand, he discovered, as he had
ventured to hope, a heavy key in the lock. He
silently withdrew it, closed the door, and turned
the key on the outside; Abdul at the same
time, taking the cue, did the same with the other
door on the left. Both locks squeaked somewhat,
and Tom thought he heard voices within.
Without waiting, however, to assure himself on
this point—feeling that he had the inmates
secure, at least for a time—he pushed on down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
the stairway, followed by Abdul, and they came,
as they had expected, upon a strong door bolted
on their side. Tom gently slid the bolts, opened
the door, and found himself in a small vestibule.
On the far side of this was another door, which
the Moor thought was the inner door of the
guest-chamber. This Tom expected would be
locked on the outside, but when he flashed his
torch at it he saw that the bolts were not shot.
He turned the handle of the door, which opened
outwards. No doubt, he thought, the Moors
considered their prisoner quite safe without
the necessity of locking him in from this
side. Access to the lower quarters being barred,
they would not object to his going up to the
roof, perhaps, for fresh air. The other door to
the right of the guest-chamber leading on to the
terrace was securely locked, as Abdul proved by
pushing it gently so as to avoid noise.
</p>
<p>
Tom tiptoed through the door, and cautiously
lowering his torch in order to avoid
flashing it on any window openings on the far
side, swept it round the room. He gave a start
of keen disappointment when he found that the
place was untenanted. It bore traces of recent
occupation, but the occupant, whoever he was,
had been removed. There were a couple of
bright oriental rugs on the floor, a dish such as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
the Moors are accustomed to serve sweetmeats
on, and one or two other native articles; but
on one of the rugs lay a well-browned brier
pipe, which was clearly of European origin, and
indeed Tom was conscious of the familiar odour
of tobacco—a very different smell from that
made by the kief or hashish smoked by the Moors.
And, strangest contrast of all, a somewhat tattered
newspaper, and a bulky volume in a red
paper cover, showed that the sheikh’s prisoner
had certainly inhabited this room, and had found
some means of lightening his captivity.
</p>
<p>
Tom took in these details in a moment. Anxious
to further his errand, he did not pause to
look at the contents of the room minutely, but
hurried across to a door on the farther side,
leading, he suspected, to the terrace. This was
bolted, but from the inside.
</p>
<p>
He halted in perplexity. What had become
of the prisoner?
</p>
<p>
“Have they taken him to the upper apartments?”
he asked Abdul in a whisper.
</p>
<p>
“No, master,” replied the lad. “No Moor
would think of it.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you think he has been released? But
no: that is unlikely. Salathiel would certainly
not have come so far in that case, would
he?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
</p>
<p>
“No. The mouse does not put his head in
the jaws of the lion.”
</p>
<p>
“And the smell of tobacco is quite fresh. I
believe the prisoner has only lately been removed.
Where would they take him if they feared an
attempt at rescue?”
</p>
<p>
With a significant look Abdul pointed downwards.
</p>
<p>
“The dungeons, eh? Where are they?”
</p>
<p>
“Under the ground, master.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, we must get down there if we can.
Do you know the way?”
</p>
<p>
The Moor hesitated. He knew too well the
fate of unhappy people who had offended the
sheikh, and upon whom the sheikh exercised the
power of life and death. Once, in Tangier, he
had accompanied a friend to such a dungeon,
where his friend’s father was confined for denying
that he possessed hidden treasure. The man’s
eyes had been put out, one of his hands had been
cut off, and he had languished for years in this
loathsome place, where he would have starved but
for the food brought him daily by his son, and
handed to him through a grating. Abdul had no
wish to see the inside of the kasbah’s dungeon.
</p>
<p>
But his hesitation was only momentary. Tom
was clearly determined to pursue his object, and
the Moor reflected that, whatever he did, he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
in parlous danger. Besides, did not everything
happen by the will of Allah? If it was decreed
that he should die, he would die; if he was
doomed to a living death in prison, nothing that
he could do would avert his fate. So, with a
Moor’s habitual fatalism, he told his employer
all he knew.
</p>
<p>
There was doubtless one entrance to the
dungeon from the patio beneath, where the
jailer occupied a room near the great gateway.
But there must also be an entrance from within
the house. Below the vestibule in which they
then stood was probably another vestibule,
dividing the rooms of the servants’ apartments.
Whether there was any communication between
the two vestibules he did not know; perhaps it
was from the terrace outside. In all probability
the inner entrance to the dungeon was from the
vestibule below.
</p>
<p>
This gave Tom pause. So far he had been
unmolested; indeed, it was only a couple of
minutes since he had left the roof. But the
thought of having to pass the servants’ apartments
was decidedly unpleasant. The sentry’s shot
must have been heard; he wondered why the
servants had not already come up to warn or to
take orders from the sheikh. Luckily the sheikh
himself and all his family were securely locked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
in their apartments. The menials might at any
rate be expected to prove less formidable.
</p>
<p>
There was no time to be lost. It suddenly
occurred to Tom that the floor of the vestibule
might have a kind of trapdoor. He pulled
aside one of the rugs that covered the stones;
there was indeed a trapdoor, not secured in any
way. Down he went on hands and knees. Releasing
the button of the electric torch so that
the room was in darkness, he lifted the door
half an inch, and guessed from the absence of
light that the vestibule below was unoccupied.
He cautiously raised the covering still farther
and listened. There was no sound. He set his
foot on a ladder beneath, and, moving so slowly
and gently as to make not so much as a rustle, he
went down step by step, pausing once or twice
to strain his ears. Still there was no sound.
When he reached the floor he ventured to flash
a light around him. He saw he was in a stone-flagged
chamber of equal size with the vestibule
above. In the middle of the floor was a circular
stone slab with an iron ring on it, and a thick
iron bolt was shut into a socket. There was one
door to the room, and, hurrying to it, Tom found
that it was fastened on the outside.
</p>
<p>
So far all was well. He softly summoned
Abdul to descend. Then, drawing back the bolt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
and lifting the slab, he discovered a large opening
leading to a spiral stone stairway.
</p>
<p>
Again he hesitated. What lay below? The
disappointment of finding the guest-chamber
empty, the prolongation of the search, were
beginning to tell upon him. But, crushing down
his nervous excitement, he extinguished his torch
again, and groped his way round and round until
he came once more to level ground. All was
still as death. A flash of the torch showed him
that he was in a large vaulted corridor, paved
with brick. Somewhere in this, he doubted not,
was the door into the dungeons.
</p>
<p>
In order to secure his line of retreat in case of
emergency, he felt it was absolutely necessary
first to secure the other entrance, wherever it
might be, that was ordinarily used by the jailer.
He soon discovered it by the aid of his torch.
Here, as he feared, the bolts were on the outside,
and the door was securely fastened. Was
it possible to barricade the door from the inside?
The whole place was empty with the exception
of a number of manacles and like effects, and a
long hammer, which Abdul said, in a whisper,
was used by the Moorish jailers in fastening the
chains round their victims’ ankles. But there
was nothing that promised to be of service as a
barricade.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
</p>
<p>
At any moment the jailer, if he had not taken
panic from the discharge of the sentry’s musket,
might enter to assure himself of the security of
his prisoners. Could anything be done to delay
him? For Tom felt that it was not only a
question of the jailer, but of others who would
no doubt hasten to his assistance.
</p>
<p>
Flashing his torch round, Tom noticed that
the flooring had been worn and chipped away,
no doubt in the process of manacling, and scattered
about there was a large quantity of loose
particles of brick. An idea struck him. He
collected a big handful of these fragments and
pushed them into the keyhole. Then, leaving
Abdul to complete the work, which would, he
hoped, cause the lock to stick, he hastened down
the vaulted passage.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>CHAPTER XI—PRISON BREAKERS</h2>
<p>
Tom found himself in a long broad alley-way,
flanked by arches. There was no
sign of the dungeons, apparently no means of
exit. The air was damp and heavy, and the
first indication that he was approaching the
neighbourhood of the dungeons was afforded
by his nose. Coming at length to a narrow
flight of steps leading downwards, the fact that
he was nearing the object of his quest was borne
in upon his sense with ever-increasing pungency.
</p>
<p>
“Surely,” he thought, “the sheikh is not
such a beast as to herd Ingleton with the ordinary
criminals!”
</p>
<p>
Another alley-way, apparently underneath the
one from which he had come, was disclosed by
his electric torch when he reached the bottom
of the staircase; but in this case there were
doors at his right, and in the thickness of the wall,
Moorish fashion, little peep-holes, through which
no doubt the warder could spy upon the movements
of the captives within.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
</p>
<p>
Which was the door leading to the place of
the envoy’s confinement? Tom wondered. Was
he indeed imprisoned here at all? Tom gave
no thought to the predicament in which Abdul
and he would be placed if it should prove that
they had gone astray; his whole mind was
centred on the plight of the English prisoner
and the terrible misfortune it would be if he
were elsewhere, and deep within him burned
a fierce indignation that any countryman of his
should be even within hailing distance of so
noisome a place as this kasbah dungeon.
</p>
<p>
So anxious was he to know whether he was on
the right track that, scarcely giving a thought
to possible consequences, he lifted up his voice
and shouted the name of the man for whom he
was seeking. The loud tones went rolling beneath
the arches, answered by a hundred echoes. But
there was a nearer and more material answer.
By the light of his torch, which he kept constantly
in use, Tom saw a big, bearded, spectacled
face appear at the aperture nearest to him
on the right.
</p>
<p>
“Ach! Gott in Himmel! Vas zat English
voice?”
</p>
<p>
Tom himself was in shadow, but his light fell
full on the face of the speaker, and with a gasp
of amazement he recognized Herr Hildebrand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
Schwab, the representative of the Schlagintwerts,
who had called on him at Midfont months before
and showed such a consuming curiosity to know
the use to which he put the Photographic Sensitizer
Preparation Number Six. And with a
sudden flash of recollection he remembered that
Schwab had spoken of proceeding to Morocco
on business. Coming out from beneath the
arch in which he stood, and holding his torch
before him, he approached the aperture. His
appearance was hailed by a groan. Schwab did
not recognize him in his Moorish dress. Deeply
he groaned again, muttering—
</p>
<p>
“Ach, Ich Unglücklicher!”
</p>
<p>
His face, utterly woebegone in expression,
was just disappearing within the cell when Tom,
almost frantic with despair at the thought that
the white prisoner was not the man he had come
to seek after all, shouted again—
</p>
<p>
“Ingleton! Sir Mark Ingleton! Are you there?”
</p>
<p>
Schwab’s face reappeared instantly. It was
aglow with excitement and hope.
</p>
<p>
“Gott sei Dank! Ingleton! You zay Ingleton!
Zough ze dress be Mohr, ze voice is
English. You are indeed English? Answer me
for ze love of ze heavens!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I am English,” cried Tom impatiently;
“I want Sir Mark Ingleton.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
</p>
<p>
“He is here, vizin, inside, viz me, Hildebrand
Schwab. Let me out double-quick; I stifle, I
suffocate, I do not breaze. Gott sei dank!”
</p>
<p>
“He is there? Where is he? Tell him I
want to speak to him—an Englishman.”
</p>
<p>
“He sleep sound, he is indispose; but I am
ze vorst. I am here ze longest. Open ze door,
please, be good enough, have ze kindness——”
</p>
<p>
Without more ado, Tom drew back the bolts
with a bang and pulled at the door. It was
locked. Schwab groaned again; but Tom,
handing his torch to Abdul, who was pale with
apprehension, called to Schwab to stand away
from the door, and blew the lock in with a shot
from his revolver. He flung open the door, and
burst into the cell. The shot had awakened the
envoy, who looked up in a dazed fashion, and
asked, in the low voice of a man thoroughly tired,
what the disturbance was about.
</p>
<p>
“God be praise, we are save! Do not notice
ze dress; it is nozink; ze man is English. Ach!
it is no good; ze door is open, but ve are in
chains. Ach! Zum Teufel! It is kaput—all
up!”
</p>
<p>
Tom pushed past him impatiently.
</p>
<p>
“Quick, Abdul,” he said, “the hammer!”
</p>
<p>
Hastening to Sir Mark, who had risen from
the floor, with half a dozen sturdy blows Tom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
snapped the chains that fixed his ankle bands
to staples in the wall, then performed the like
service for Schwab. He made no attempt
to release their ankles from the fetters: there
was no time for this, and he feared also to do
them an injury. The sounds had caused commotion
in the further dungeon, where the sheikh’s
other prisoners were confined. Chains were
clanking, men were shouting, the uproar was so
great that it must reach the ears of the jailer if
he were anywhere in the neighbourhood, and
though he was shut off from the vaults, he might
burst the locks and bring a host of armed men
to the rescue.
</p>
<p>
“We have no time to lose,” said Tom. “Come
with me.”
</p>
<p>
“But, pardon me——” said Sir Mark.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t explain now,” Tom interrupted.
“Come along; it is all right, only we must get
away at once.”
</p>
<p>
“At vunce, Sir Ingleton,” said Schwab. “You
hear zat! For ze sake of anyzink, be a man!”
</p>
<p>
“My good sir——” began Sir Mark: but
Tom again cut him short.
</p>
<p>
“Can you walk?” he asked, noticing that
the Englishman tottered as he stood.
</p>
<p>
“With assistance, perhaps.”
</p>
<p>
At once Tom caught him by an arm, bidding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
Abdul take the other. Supporting him, they
led him along the passage, up the stairway to
the upper corridor, Schwab panting and ejaculating
behind them. Even before they reached
the corridor they heard a tremendous battering
at the door whose lock had been filled with fragments
of brick.
</p>
<p>
It was so stout a barrier that Tom had no fear
that it would be broken down by anything short
of a battering ram, and it was not likely that
the Moors had at hand an instrument ready for
this purpose. His confidence was, however,
soon shaken, for, before the party, encumbered
with the enfeebled envoy, had begun to ascend
the winding stairway leading from the arched corridor
to the vestibule above, there was the sound
of a very heavy body striking the door, followed
by an ominous creak. Leaving the others to
precede him, Tom stationed himself on the
narrow stair, the hammer in one hand, his revolver
in the other. He was determined not to
use the revolver except in the last extremity, but
he had no such compunctions about using the
hammer.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly in the midst of the crashing blows
upon the door there was the report of a rifle.
The Moors were adopting his own device of
blowing in the lock. The door gave way, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
by the flash of his torch, Tom saw a crowd of
swarthy Riffians swarming through the opening.
The door at the foot of the winding stair leading
to the corridor was somewhat ruinous; it was
apparently seldom used, the sheikh depending
for his security upon the heavy trapdoor above.
Tom, however, succeeded in pulling it to before
the Moors were upon him, and shot the single
crazy bolt that still held. Then he darted up
the stairs after the rest. They were just lifting
the envoy through the trap. Schwab was
waiting his turn, and when he heard Tom rushing
up, he sprang through the opening with
extraordinary agility. The trapdoor was let
down and bolted; they hastened up the stairway
to the upper vestibule adjoining the guest-chamber,
thence up to the sheikh’s quarters on
the floor above, bolting every door behind them.
</p>
<p>
Even through the thick walls of the kasbah
they had heard sounds of great excitement in
the town. Evidently the whole place was now
alive. And there was danger to be anticipated
within, for as they groped their way up the last
flight of stairs leading to the roof, their steps
momentarily guided by the flashes of Tom’s
torches, the sounds of a tremendous battering
near at hand struck upon their ears. Evidently
the sheikh himself was now trying to make his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
way out. They hastened their steps as much
as Sir Mark’s enfeebled state permitted; Tom
indeed was in such desperate anxiety, for pursuit
could not be long delayed, that he forced the
pace in a way that drew a protest from the
Englishman—even in this extremity a diplomatist.
</p>
<p>
They came to the last flight of stairs leading
to the roof.
</p>
<p>
“Is that you, Dorrell?” came the voice of
Oliphant from above. Nervously restless, first
on account of Tom’s long absence, and then at
the violent sounds within and without the
building, he had left the airship and stationed
himself with his revolver at the top of the staircase
leading to the roof, to cover Tom’s retreat
if he proved to be hard pressed.
</p>
<p>
“All well!” shouted Tom in reply.
</p>
<p>
In another minute all four emerged upon the
roof, and Oliphant gave a whistle of amazement
and consternation when he saw an unexpected
addition to the party.
</p>
<p>
“Two of them?” he ejaculated.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; the sheikh had a German gentleman—”
</p>
<p>
“Hildebrand Schwab, representative of ze
excellent firma of Schlagintwert and——”
</p>
<p>
“Hang it, we can’t stop for introductions
now,” said Tom. “Abdul, run down to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
door of the sheikh’s room and persuade him that
he risks his life if he comes out. We shall want
a minute or two to get ready.”
</p>
<p>
The Moor obeyed, not without a look of nervousness.
At first he could scarcely make his
voice heard above the uproar within the sheikh’s
room; but succeeding at last, he began a conversation
which might have shocked and would
certainly have amused Tom if he could have
understood it.
</p>
<p>
“Is the most excellent lord the sheikh within?”
shouted Abdul at the top of his voice.
</p>
<p>
The noise ceased.
</p>
<p>
“Certainly he is, thou misbegotten son of a
pig!” said the frenzied sheikh. “Open this
door, or by the beard of the Prophet I will flay
thee alive, thou rat.”
</p>
<p>
“Peace, O sheikh! Dost thou value thy life
so little, foolish one?” Abdul was gaining
courage; his enemy was on the other side of the
door. “Peace, thou kaffir; I spit upon thee.
Dost thou think to pass through till it be the
good pleasure of those who have captured thy
kasbah to permit thee? Know it is I, Abdul
ben Cassim, and verily I and the good men with
me will cut thee in pieces, first plucking out one
by one the hairs of thy beard, if thou showest
thy pig’s snout beyond this door.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
</p>
<p>
This seemed to stagger the sheikh, for his
next words were uttered in a milder tone.
</p>
<p>
“What is thy purpose, O Abdul?”
</p>
<p>
“Know, thou dog of a dog, that a great sultan,
the King of England, hath sent his most trusty
wazeer to wrest from thee his servant, whom thou
didst treacherously seize and shut in thy stinking
dungeon. There now lies at this very door a
monstrous bomb which will go off—Allah is
great!—the instant this door is opened. Dost
thou believe, dog? Verily thou wilt be shattered
into as many pieces as there are lies in thy
heart if thou dost but move the door the tenth
part of an inch. But the King of England is
merciful; he will not do you or your folk harm:
he knows other ways of avenging the injury his servant
has suffered at thy hands. Verily thou art
in bad case, thou two-faced dog. Before the
growing of a fingernail thou wilt be haled to
Marrakesh, and then thou wilt suffer the pangs
of Tophet.”
</p>
<p>
And Abdul went on to revile the sheikh in
terms that cannot be rendered in our modest
English. His inventiveness was very creditable
to his presence of mind, for though the noise in
the sheikh’s apartments had ceased, the uproar
below was growing moment by moment in
intensity. The great gate had been thrown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
open, the patio was thronged with fierce Moors
enraged at the indignity put upon their chief,
and it was scarcely possible that the doors below,
stout as they were, could long withstand the
furious blows with which they were assailed.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Tom had assured himself that his
machinery was in order. Sir Mark had already
entered the car. Tom was beside him, ready to
start the propellers; Schwab was ensconced in
the corner furthest from danger.
</p>
<p>
“Call Abdul, Oliphant,” said Tom.
</p>
<p>
Oliphant went to the head of the stairs and
called; Abdul came bounding up, and in half
a minute all five were packed into the car. It
was a very tight fit, and Tom felt a tremor of
apprehension as he pressed the lever. The
vertical propellers answered instantly to his
touch, but they beat the air ineffectually: the
airship absolutely refused to rise.
</p>
<p>
“It won’t lift us!” he said, aghast. “We’re
too heavy. Some one must be left behind.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll stay,” said Oliphant at once. “Take
the others to the hill and come back for me. I
can manage for half an hour or so with my
revolver.”
</p>
<p>
“Not a bit of it. I want your help with the
machinery. What on earth can we do?”
</p>
<p>
“Leave Abdul?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
</p>
<p>
“Can’t hear of it: he couldn’t defend himself
long, and he’d be frightfully tortured if they
got him. We can’t all get away at once, that’s
certain; and, as we certainly can’t leave Sir Mark,
we must leave the one we didn’t reckon on.
Herr Schwab——”
</p>
<p>
“No. I refuse. I vill not stay. I am here.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m afraid you must. We shan’t be long.
I’ll drop the others a mile or two away, and come
back for you at once.”
</p>
<p>
“Never in ze vorld. I protest. I am Jarman
sobjeck: is not ze life of Jarman sobjeck
of more vorth zan ze life of a Mohr? Our Kaiser,
who is in Berlin——”
</p>
<p>
“We can’t stop to argue it. They won’t
kill you, at any rate; they know enough of your
Kaiser perhaps to refrain from that: whereas
they’d kill the Moor to a certainty. We can’t
all lose our lives for you. In short, you must
get out, and be quick about it, or, by Jove! we’ll
have to throw you out.”
</p>
<p>
“It is terrible; it is unkind. I cannot stay
alone; no longer am I as I vas; I lose pounds in
ze prison. I am not made for zis. Some vun
muss remain viz me; I care not who: some
vun to give me courage.”
</p>
<p>
Here Abdul stepped into the breach and
volunteered to stay with the German.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
</p>
<p>
“I have it!” cried Oliphant. “The trapdoor
that covers the opening is at the other
end of the roof, by the parapet there. We can
shut that down and bolt it. And, by George!
the stones of the parapet are pretty loose. Abdul
and Mr. Schwab can pile some of them on the trap;
we’ll leave them our revolvers, and with a little
pluck they can keep the blackguards at bay until
we get back.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s it. You’ll be as safe as the Bank of
England, Mr. Schwab. Quick! Out with you!
Here’s my revolver!”
</p>
<p>
“Ach! I am man of peace; vunce I vas var
gorresbondent, and——”
</p>
<p>
“For goodness’ sake get out, man. Don’t
you see you’re endangering the whole lot of us,
yourself included. Oliphant, we shall have to
fling him out.”
</p>
<p>
But at this threat Schwab rose and stepped
on to the roof, his face a very picture of woe.
Oliphant assisted Abdul to place the trapdoor
over the opening, and of course made the discovery
that the bolts were on the inside.
</p>
<p>
“But the stones will do,” said Oliphant.
“Buck up, Mr. Schwab; you’re not absolutely
helpless, are you?”
</p>
<p>
“It is true, I have carried stones, but zey vere
small,” said Schwab lugubriously, remembering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
the means by which he had mounted the fence
at Midfont in pursuit of business. Leaving him
to it, Oliphant got back into the car. Tom
pressed the lever, and the airship, relieved of
near two hundredweight of German subject and
the lesser bulk of the Moor, soared into the air.
Tom’s last view, as the vessel rose clear of the
kasbah, was Schwab limping across the roof
under the burden of a large stone from the
coping.
</p>
<p>
“A most singular proceeding!” murmured
Sir Mark, as the airship whirred over the hills.
“I wonder how I stand—diplomatically considered.
The vessel goes with consummate ease.
There is positively no roll—nothing to cause
seasickness.”
</p>
<p>
Tom laughed. The matter-of-fact at this
moment was very refreshing.
</p>
<p>
“I hope you will redeem your promise to
rescue Mr. Schwab,” the envoy continued. “He
has been a great joy to me in my captivity.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh yes, we’ll get him. We shall drop you
in a few minutes. You will not mind being left
for a little while?”
</p>
<p>
“Not at all, not at all. I find the air and
the motion most invigorating. I have lately
been very conscious of the inconvenience of
having a nose.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
</p>
<p>
Tom did not know, though Oliphant suspected,
that Sir Mark’s cool manner was adopted intentionally—to
ease the strain on their nerves. A
man is not trained to diplomacy for nothing.
He kept up a quiet flow of nothings until the
hill was reached.
</p>
<p>
“A very airy situation,” he remarked, as he
was set down on the hill-top.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. You’ll find it cold,” said Tom.
“Here’s my coat.”
</p>
<p>
“Thanks. Having escaped asphyxia, it would
certainly be a pity to contract pneumonia. You
look quite comfortable yourself: the Moorish
djellab is a very warm garment, I should think.”
</p>
<p>
He put on Tom’s reefer, which had lain in a
corner of the car. Then Tom sent the airship
aloft again, and hurried back to the kasbah.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII—A HITCH</h2>
<p>
Short as the time seemed, it was in reality
nearly an hour before the airship once
more rested on the roof of the kasbah. While
it was still hovering above, Tom manœuvring for
a landing, there came the muffled sound of
shots and the rending of wood.
</p>
<p>
“They’ve broken in,” cried Oliphant.
</p>
<p>
The Moors had indeed burst through the
lower doors, released the infuriated sheikh, and,
finding themselves unable to lift the trapdoor,
were firing upwards through it. Schwab, who
had been sitting on the pile of stones which he
and Abdul had heaped on the covering, to reinforce
their weight with his own, slipped off with
amazing alacrity just as the airship came to
rest.
</p>
<p>
“Gott sei Dank!” he exclaimed, as Tom
joined him.
</p>
<div><a name='illus187' id='illus187'></a></div>

<span class='caption'>“TOM, SEIZING A BIG STONE, THREW IT WITH ALL<br/>HIS FORCE INTO THE BLACK ROOM BENEATH.”</span>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span></div>
<p>
He needed no invitation to hurry into the
car. As soon as Abdul was aboard Tom started
the engines. To his consternation the airship
again refused to rise.
</p>
<p>
“Good heavens! what a weight you must
be!” he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“Colossal! But I lose pounds in ze——”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, shut up!” cried Oliphant impatiently.
“We can’t make another journey, Dorrell. The
cover won’t support the stones much longer with
those ruffians smashing the wood as they’re
doing.”
</p>
<p>
He had scarcely spoken when the woodwork
gave way, the stones crashed down the staircase,
and there were cries of pain and alarm from
the men beneath. But it was impossible to
suppose that they were all hurt, and the passage
was now clear for the rest. Something must be
done at once to gain a little time until the
problem of removing Schwab’s colossal weight
could be solved.
</p>
<p>
Stopping his engines, which were working
furiously, but with no effect, Tom, followed by
Oliphant and the Moor, jumped from the car
and hurried towards the opening. They were
greeted by a musket shot; but Tom, seizing a
big stone, threw it with all his force into the
black room beneath. There were more cries
from below, repeated when Oliphant and the
Moor followed suit, each with missiles of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
same character. Then there was silence for a
time. The Moors were apparently nonplussed.
</p>
<p>
“You can find your way to the hill if I land
you below?” asked Tom of Abdul.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, master.”
</p>
<p>
“Hold the roof, Oliphant. I won’t be ten
minutes. Don’t shoot ’em unless you’re very
hard pressed.”
</p>
<p>
Tom and the Moor sprang into the car, the
airship again ascended, and came down about a
quarter of a mile from the village walls. There
was nobody in sight; without doubt the whole
population of the place was congregated about
the kasbah. Once more Tom ascended, alighting
on the roof just as Oliphant, using the wooden
shaft of Abdul’s hammer, was driving back one
man, more venturesome than the rest, who had
attempted to make his way up. There was no
time to carry more stones from the coping to
serve as missiles, so Tom and Oliphant at last
fired their revolvers, two shots each, taking care,
however, to avoid the opening. Tom hoped
that the sound of the shots would give pause to
the men below, most of whom must have hitherto
been unaware that the intruders carried firearms.
</p>
<p>
Immediately after they had fired, the two
made a dash for the car, scrambled aboard, and
set the engines in motion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
</p>
<p>
“Gott sei Dank!” cried Schwab again, as
the airship rose steadily above the roof.
</p>
<p>
As if they had known by some intuition what
was happening, the Moors at this moment made
a rush, and before the airship had sailed a hundred
yards from the kasbah, figures appeared on the
roof. A moment afterwards one or two shots
were fired, but they were without effect; the
airship sailed on, pursued by yells of baffled rage.
</p>
<p>
In order to draw away pursuit from his real
direction, Tom headed the airship north-east,
and it was not until he was well out of sight of
the kasbah that he put the helm up and steered
straight for the hill-top.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve come out of this uncommonly well,”
said Oliphant. “I was on thorns all the time
you and Abdul were absent.”
</p>
<p>
“We’re not out of it yet,” rejoined Tom.
“The fuel’s nearly done. These comings and
goings have used a terrible lot of the paste, and
I doubt whether there’s enough to make one
journey to the yacht—let alone two. I didn’t
reckon on another passenger besides Ingleton.”
</p>
<p>
“Who is this freak? You seem to know
him?” Oliphant spoke quietly: Herr Schwab
was lying against the rail of the car only a few
feet away.
</p>
<p>
“Met him once. His name’s Schwab; he’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
an agent for the company I get my powder from.
Haven’t had time yet to ask him how he got
into this mess. I say, it looks as if a storm is
coming up.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, the wind’s rising, and the clouds are
scudding along at a great pace. How will she
behave in a storm?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t know, and don’t want to know just
now. We should be in a pretty hobble if the
machine were to get smashed up altogether.”
</p>
<p>
While Tom and Oliphant were thus talking
in low tones, Herr Schwab was deeply ruminating.
He had been struck, on the roof of the kasbah,
by something familiar in the speech of this
Englishman who was masquerading as a Moor,
but in the agitation of the moment he could not
sift his recollections. Now, however, safe in the
car of an aeroplane, sailing with almost imperceptible
motion through the air, he was taking
the opportunity to search his memory. Just as
the airship arrived above the hill-top where Sir
Mark Ingleton was waiting, and Tom was preparing
to descend, he was startled by a loud
exclamation from the German.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Nozink, nozink at all. I know you vat you
are. Mr. Thomas Dorrell! And ze Photographic
Sensitizer Preparation Number Six. I know all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
about him; jawohl! Zere are business for
Schlagintwert: I do not mind ze captivities
now: business are business.”
</p>
<p>
Oliphant looked inquiringly at Tom; but the
moment was not propitious for explanations.
Tom’s whole attention was engaged by the
machinery. The airship alighted without mishap,
and Tom as he stepped out of the car was
greeted by Sir Mark Ingleton.
</p>
<p>
“I have a new conception of the music of the
spheres,” he said. “Your approach was heralded
by an immense humming, which, I take it, will
discount the usefulness of the airship in time of
war.”
</p>
<p>
“Zat vill be chance for Schlagintwert,” interposed
Schwab: “to invent somezink vat stop ze
row.”
</p>
<p>
“Precisely,” said Sir Mark, with a faint smile.
</p>
<p>
“How do you feel now, sir?” asked Tom.
</p>
<p>
“Greatly invigorated by the fresh air. I am
glad of your coat. May I know to whom I
am indebted for this surprising change in my
fortunes?”
</p>
<p>
“My name’s Dorrell,” said Tom. “I happened
to be rather lucky in getting my airship to
go just when it could be made useful.”
</p>
<p>
“Viz Schlagintwert’s Photographic Sensitizer
Preparation Number Six,” added Schwab.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
</p>
<p>
“This is Mr. Oliphant, Lord Langside’s son,”
Tom went on.
</p>
<p>
“Indeed!” With fine courtesy Sir Mark
perfectly concealed his amazement. Oliphant
still wore his stoker’s clothes, and the black
smudges on his face had given him a striking
resemblance to a coal-heaver. “I am grateful
to the Prime Minister for this novel and adventurous
expedition,” added the envoy.
</p>
<p>
“My father knows nothing about it, sir,” said
Oliphant. “We were afraid he wouldn’t allow
it if we told him.”
</p>
<p>
“I see. Nothing succeeds like success. Did
you come all the way from England in this
admirable machine?”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir. We were brought out on Mr.
Greatorex’s yacht, which is now waiting for us
at the shore.”
</p>
<p>
“That is good news, for in truth, seeing the
limited carrying capacity of your airship, I had
wondered how we were all to get away.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s our difficulty, sir. Our fuel is almost
gone, and I’m very much afraid there isn’t enough
left to make even one journey back to the yacht.
There’s plenty on board, if we <em>can</em> manage to
reach it.”
</p>
<p>
“In that case perhaps you and Mr. Oliphant
had better return without us. If you reach the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
yacht safely, you can come back and fetch us;
if you do not—well, things will be no worse than
they were.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t care about doing that, sir. We came
out to rescue you. I think you had better come
with us. Our fuel may last out; the sooner you
are safe aboard the yacht the better; and if we
only get within sight of her it will be all right,
for Mr. Greatorex will certainly send a boat’s
crew to fetch us off.”
</p>
<p>
“Had you not better take Mr. Schwab first?
He has been in captivity longer than I.”
</p>
<p>
“And I have vair important business,” said
Schwab eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“I think my arrangement is best, sir. You
see, your position is a matter of state importance—international
importance, I might say;
all Europe is more or less interested in your fate,
whereas——”
</p>
<p>
“Ach!” interrupted Schwab, “zey insult
me, ze Mohrs; me, a Jarman sobjeck; zerefore
zey insult also our Kaiser, who is in Berlin. Zat
is important.”
</p>
<p>
“With all respect to your Kaiser, Mr.
Schwab,” said Tom, “we are three to one
here, and I think the interests of the majority
must prevail.”
</p>
<p>
“But ze population of Jarmany is grosser zan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
ze population of Great Britain. Ve grow vair
fast.”
</p>
<p>
“Therefore your Kaiser can spare one individual
better than our King. We must settle
it so, Mr. Schwab. We’ll take Sir Mark to the
yacht and then come back for you—as we have
already done.”
</p>
<p>
“But if you forget—vere am I zen? Mr.
Greatorex is business man, perhaps he vant to
make haste for home. Besides, you try to keep
ze secret of ze Photographic Sensitizer Preparation
Number Six. I discover ze secret. You vant
to keep me out, so zat I shall not take out patent
for Schlagintwert. Zat is business!”
</p>
<p>
“You may take my word for it that we’ll
come back for you,” said Tom patiently. Oliphant
was fuming: Sir Mark Ingleton was
quietly enjoying the situation. “And here’s
Abdul.” The young Moor at this moment
came over the brow of the hill. “Perhaps he
will stay and keep you company.”
</p>
<p>
“I have enough gombany of ze Mohrs,” said
Schwab dismally. “Give notice, I shall have big
claim for damage. Ze loss of business is colossal.”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll make it up when you put your Photographic
Sensitizer Preparation Number Six on
the market under a new name. Abdul, you will
stay with Mr. Schwab until we get back?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
</p>
<p>
Abdul agreed at once. In the event of a
party coming from Ain Afroo to capture him he
could retreat to the caves, which were so difficult
of access that he might hope to defy attack for
a time, even if his hiding-place were discovered.
The chief difficulty would be food and water;
but he could slip down into the woods before
daybreak and gather a quantity of fruit; perhaps
also snare one or two wild animals; and if Tom
would leave behind the now almost empty
canister in which he kept the fuel for the engines,
he could fill that with water from the hill springs.
</p>
<p>
Schwab’s countenance, as he heard these
arrangements discussed, was that of a man very ill
at ease. But he had apparently come to the conclusion
that further protest would be unavailing,
and he held his peace, summing up in his mind,
possibly, the amount of his future claim for
damages. Tom handed Abdul his revolver, for
use in the last resort; then followed Oliphant
and the envoy into the car.
</p>
<p>
“You keep your vord!” cried Schwab, as the
airship rose into the now overclouded sky.
</p>
<p>
Tom set the engines at half speed, partly to
husband his fuel, partly because, moon and stars
being now obscured, he felt the same kind of
reluctance to go fast that a driver would feel in
going through a dark country lane. It was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
little before three in the morning. He hoped
to reach the yacht about dawn, though, having
in the darkness no means of guiding his course, he
foresaw the possibility of going out of the way.
But a strong wind had blown up from the east,
and with this at his back he knew that he must
in due time reach the sea. Rain began to fall,
at first in large scattered drops, finally in a steady
downpour, and when the grey dawn at last broke
through the sky, all three occupants of the car
were thoroughly drenched and miserable.
</p>
<p>
Tom had anxiously watched his fuel supply.
When the rain ceased and the sky became clearer,
and he caught sight of the sea afar off, he saw that
there was not the smallest chance of reaching
the shore.
</p>
<p>
“How far is it, do you think?” asked Oliphant.
</p>
<p>
“More than ten miles, I fancy. I’ve scraped
up the last ounces of paste; we shall be lucky
if it carries us another five miles.”
</p>
<p>
“And what then?”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness knows! I don’t know what part
of the shore we are heading for. We may be
miles north or south of the yacht for all I can
tell.”
</p>
<p>
“Will they see us on board?”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t think so. You see, the yacht, when we
left her, was moored pretty close inshore, and,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
unless she runs out a good way, the cliffs will
intercept the view. By Jove! we haven’t come
far wrong, though. You see those two islands?
I noticed them from the deck. They’re a few
miles south of where we lay to. Here goes the
last of the fuel, Oliphant; we can’t keep up more
than five minutes. The only thing to be done
is to let her down at a suitable spot, and then
gain the shore on foot, and attract the attention
of some one on board. No doubt they’re keeping
a pretty keen lookout.”
</p>
<p>
They were now passing over a considerable
stretch of wooded country. But as Tom was
looking about for a place convenient for landing,
he saw to his consternation that they were within
sight of a village of some size. The airship
was no more than six hundred feet from the
ground: Tom had not dared to keep it at any
greater altitude, and he could scarcely hope
that it had escaped observation. To descend
at once was absolutely imperative: yet a descent
in full sight of the village would certainly bring
unwelcome and hostile visitors. In order to
stave off, even for a time, the inevitable, he
selected a spot that seemed to be about a couple
of miles from the village—a large clearing in the
midst of the wood, about halfway up a gently
rising hill. There he dropped gently to earth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
</p>
<p>
The airship had scarcely come to rest before
he saw, from the village below, a party of horsemen
issuing at full speed from the gate. Tom
counted more than a dozen men, and within a
minute these were followed by another dozen.
</p>
<p>
“We’re in for it now,” he said. “They’ll
be on us in a few minutes.”
</p>
<p>
“We can’t fight ’em with only one revolver
and a carbine,” said Oliphant ruefully. “They’ll
collar us and hold us to ransom—perhaps we’ll
all find ourselves before long in the kasbah of
Ain Afroo.”
</p>
<p>
“May I make a suggestion?” said Sir Mark
Ingleton. “The airship has failed us; we are,
it appears, about to be surrounded by horsemen
who are doubtless well armed; flight is therefore
impossible. It is equally impossible, as Mr.
Oliphant says, to fight. Before now, in similar
circumstances, diplomacy has been of some avail;
and it is but right that I, in whose behalf you
gentlemen have been brought to your present
plight, should exercise my poor abilities in disentangling
the knot.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you propose, sir?” asked Tom,
inwardly remarking that diplomacy seemed to
make a man tolerably long-winded.
</p>
<p>
“It is that Mr. Oliphant and myself should
go forth to meet these children of nature, waving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
a white handkerchief as if to welcome them. I
will explain to them, in terms they will comprehend,
and with a sufficient regard for the truth,
what our situation is. They will doubtless
convey us to their village, whether they believe
me or not. In the meantime you, Mr. Dorrell,
will have hidden yourself in a tree—no difficult
feat to a man of your years; and when you see
a fitting opportunity, you will steal your way to
the shore, rejoin your friends on the yacht, and
take such steps as may suggest themselves in
consultation with them to effect our release.”
</p>
<p>
“A capital idea!” said Tom.
</p>
<p>
“But can we do it? Can you speak to the
Moors in their own tongue?” asked Oliphant.
</p>
<p>
“My dear fellow, your father selected me for
this mission precisely on account of my knowledge
of Arabic,” said Sir Mark. “If these Riffians
do not understand me, it will be because my
speech is so much purer than theirs.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, good luck to you!” cried Tom. “I’m
off before they see me.”
</p>
<p>
And donning his djellab, which he had spread
on the ground to dry, he disappeared among
the trees.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII—DIPLOMACY</h2>
<p>
Before the band of horsemen had approached
the edge of the little plateau where the airship
lay, the two men stepped forward through
the trees at its lower edge and waved to the
oncomers with every sign of welcome.
</p>
<p>
“I hope none of them will recognize me,” said
Sir Mark in a low tone to Oliphant. “Probably
few in this wild district have ever been in Tangier,
where my features are tolerably well known;
and having been for some time unable to shave—these
followers of the Prophet are forbidden the
use of the razor, and Mr. Schwab does not carry
one—I look perhaps a little unlike myself.”
</p>
<p>
The horsemen came up at a gallop, bringing
their horses to a halt when it seemed to Oliphant
that he and his companion must be trampled
to the ground.
</p>
<p>
“Peace be with you!” said Sir Mark in
Arabic, making a slight inclination.
</p>
<p>
“And with thee, peace!” returned the leader
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
of the party, looking not a little surprised at this
orthodox salutation from a N’zrani.
</p>
<p>
“In the name of the most Merciful!” Sir
Mark continued. “Thou dost behold us in sore
straits, O Son of the Mountain. We are brothers
under our skin, thou and I, and I crave thy help.”
</p>
<p>
“Bismillah! I am thy host, and all that I
have is thine.”
</p>
<p>
“Thou sayest well. Behold this strange monster
that lieth on the ground beyond us. It was
made by a countryman of mine, to simulate the
flying of birds in the air—a most wondrous thing,
and worthy to be seen by his Shereefian Majesty
the Sultan himself. I was indeed on my way
to visit the Sultan, but was prevented by a most
untoward happening. (That is strictly true,
though the fact is somewhat post-dated,” he added
in an aside.) “Even a bird tires with overmuch
flying; and, as thou seest, this thing that imitates
the flying of a bird tires also, so much so,
indeed, that we saw that its wings would not
carry us the full extent of our journey, and we
were on our way back to the coast in order to
repair its strength, when it failed us utterly.
Wherefore, friend, we ask thee to lend us the
assistance of some sturdy men from your village
to carry our poor bird to Casa Blanca, or to any
ship that may chance to be off your shore.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
(They may have seen the yacht.) For this service
we will reward them liberally.”
</p>
<p>
“Bismillah!” ejaculated the Moor. Oliphant,
watching his face during Sir Mark’s address, had
caught a fleeting expression of perplexity and
disappointment. Expecting to make an out-and-out
capture, he was no doubt somewhat nonplussed
at this request for assistance. But he
had the Moor’s ready adaptability to circumstances.
His speech gave no sign of his thoughts.
</p>
<p>
“Bismillah!” he repeated. “We are all in
God’s hands. Let my brother give thanks to
Allah the most Merciful that he came to a man
so friendly disposed as Salaam son of Absalaam.
It shall be even as thou wishest, Sidi. But first
thou and thy son must come to my village, for
your bird yonder is too heavy to be carried without
much preparation. It will need the shoulders
of a great number of men. But while the men
are making ready, enter my house, all too unworthy
to shelter you: yet we will comfort you with
food, and do all that is in our power to please
our guests.”
</p>
<p>
“We thank thee, O Salaam, for thy proffered
hospitality, which we will accept, knowing that
all things will be provided for our comfort.”
</p>
<p>
“So be it, Sidi. But within the walls of my
village, when I first looked heavenwards and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
saw this strange flying thing, did I not see three
men borne along in it, and one of them in djellab
something like my own?”
</p>
<p>
Sir Mark smiled and, pointing to a part of
the apparatus that was coloured grey, said—
</p>
<p>
“No doubt in the distance my brother mistook
that for a person. We are two, as thou seest.”
</p>
<p>
The Moor still looked somewhat mistrustfully
around. Then, with an appearance of being
convinced, he dismounted, and ordered his
followers to dismount also, asking his guest to
choose whichever of the horses he pleased for
himself and his son. At this imputation of
kinship, Sir Mark elevated his eyebrows; the
young man was certainly a disreputable-looking
object. Thinking it policy to accept the offer,
Sir Mark mounted the head-man’s own steed,
Oliphant following his example with the horse
of one of his party. Then, bidding a score of
the men lift the airship on their shoulders, the
head-man and the rest remounted, and led the
way to the village. Both Sir Mark and Oliphant
were glad that the distance was not great, for
the high Moorish saddles were a sore trial to their
unaccustomed limbs. The envoy, at any rate,
was under no delusion as to the nature of the
hospitality promised. From the manner in which
the tribesmen escorted the two Englishmen to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
the village, there could be little doubt that they
were prisoners.
</p>
<p>
From his perch in the tree Tom noticed that
although the majority of the horsemen accompanied
his friends towards the walls, four or five
detached themselves from the party and returned
to the plantation, which they proceeded to
search pretty thoroughly. He made himself as
small as he could among the foliage when they
passed beneath him, but they did not look up;
apparently it did not occur to them that any one
should have mounted into a tree. When they
had finished their fruitless search, they went, not
in the direction their fellow-villagers had taken,
but towards the coast. Tom saw them spread
out as they rode from the plantation, and watched
them until they were mere specks in the distance.
Then, when they were, he supposed, perfectly
satisfied that the suspected third member of
the English party could not have escaped them,
they wheeled round and returned one by one
again passing not far from his hiding-place.
Clearly, if they were so suspicious, it would be
expedient for him to remain for some time in the
tree—an unpleasant prospect, for he was becoming
very stiff and cramped, and suffering rather
severely from hunger and thirst.
</p>
<p>
It was some hours before he ventured to slip
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
to the ground. Even then he did not dare to
leave the shelter of the wood, knowing that in
the open he would inevitably be observed. But
he stretched his limbs and found a few blackberries,
which somewhat appeased his hunger.
Every now and then he again climbed the tree
to find out whether any one was approaching, or
whether a watch was still being kept. Late in
the afternoon he descried, on the further side
of the village, a horseman approaching from the
direction of the hills. He came at full gallop,
and rode straight into the village, disappearing
there from Tom’s view.
</p>
<p>
“Hope to goodness he isn’t a messenger from
the sheikh!” thought Tom.
</p>
<p>
At last, when the sun had set, and the sky
was darkening, he deemed it safe to leave his
hiding-place. If the yacht had remained where
he had last seen her—and it was scarcely likely
that Mr. Greatorex would shift his anchorage—he
conjectured that a five mile walk would
bring him to the nearest point of the shore.
Fortunately it was a beautiful night, clear and
starlit, though the moon had not yet risen.
Taking his bearings very carefully by the stars,
in anticipation of a return journey, he started,
going very slowly and cautiously, watching every
shadow lest it should indicate the presence of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
Moor. Ignorant of their language, he knew
well that he had no chance whatever of slipping
past if he were once accosted. In such a case
he could trust only to his lightness of foot.
But nothing happened to cause him uneasiness,
and after trudging along for nearly two hours
he was beyond measure delighted to see what
was evidently a masthead light some distance out
at sea. No native craft would show a light; he
could hardly doubt that the <em>Dandy Dinmont</em> and
his friends were before him.
</p>
<p>
He was quickening his step in the pleasure of
this discovery, when suddenly, without warning,
he found himself at the edge of an encampment
lying in a slight hollow at the summit of the
cliffs. He started back, but it was too late. A
Moor, swathed in his hooded djellab, came out
of the darkness and spoke to him. Tom saw
that it might be fatal to run now; he walked
on, hoping that he might pass without replying.
But the Moor spoke again, more sharply, in a
more questioning tone. Tom, whose head was
covered with the hood, mumbled something
beneath his breath; but his unpractised tongue
could not achieve the hard guttural accent of
the Moorish speech, and the sentinel took a hasty
step towards him.
</p>
<p>
There was now nothing for it but to take to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
his heels. Disguise was no longer possible, and,
to free his limbs, he cast the djellab from him,
and dashed at full speed across the grass to the
edge of the cliff. The slope was steep, but he
scarcely gave a thought to the risks he ran.
Scrambling over, he lay down and rolled from
top to bottom, with many a gash and bruise
from sharp edges of the rock.
</p>
<p>
Loud shouts pursued him. The camp was
aroused. Picking himself up, feeling breathless
and dazed, he sped across the sandy stretch of
beach and sent a sounding hail in the direction
of the yacht; perchance his voice might carry
above the rustle of the surf and the cries
of his pursuers. He heard men scurrying down
a path in the cliff somewhere behind him; then
their footsteps on the light shingle that lay above
the sand. Even if his cry had been heard on
the yacht, it was impossible that a boat should
reach him before he was overtaken. There was
only one way to safety. He plunged into the
surf, and struck out towards the vessel. A shot
followed him, but he cared nothing for that; in
the darkness it would puzzle an expert marksman
to hit him, when nothing of him could be seen
but a head bobbing up and down. Not till he
had swum well out of the reach of his pursuers,
who had not followed him into the sea, did the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
thought of sharks cross his mind. Then he trod
water for a little, and, making a bell of his hands,
sent another prolonged cry across the water.
</p>
<p>
Is that an answering hail? He shouts once
more; yes, a cry comes back to him: “Ahoy-o!”
But at the same moment he hears also the sound
of paddles, to his right, apparently from a bend
of the shore. The Moors have not given him
up, then. Again he presses on, putting all his
force into a strong side-stroke. Now another
sound falls upon his ear; the welcome sound
of oars plied sturdily in rowlocks. The yacht’s
boat is coming to meet him. But the pursuers
are the nearer—will his friends arrive in time?
His long exertions since he left the yacht, his
want of food and sleep, have robbed him of
his strength. His pace becomes slower and
slower. The pursuers’ boat is coming up behind,
while yet the beat of oars before him sounds
terribly distant. But he is still swimming;
every yard he makes is a yard added to the speed
of the friendly boat. He struggled on; and
the Moors were still some distance behind when,
gasping and spent, he was helped by Timothy
and another into his ark of safety.
</p>
<p>
But the boat did not head at once for the yacht.
</p>
<p>
“Give way, men!” cried Captain Bodgers
himself, at the tiller.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
</p>
<p>
He pointed the nose of the boat straight for
the Moors’ light craft. Eight sturdy British
sailors pulled with a will. There was a crash,
a cry, and a dozen Moors were in the water,
struggling to right their capsized boat.
</p>
<p>
“That’s all right. Now we’ll get back, my
men,” said Captain Bodgers, and some few
minutes thereafter Tom was assisted up the
side of the yacht, and into the arms of Mr.
Greatorex.
</p>
<p>
“God bless my soul, what has happened?”
said the worthy merchant.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve got him—Ingleton,” murmured Tom
faintly. “He’s with Oliphant, captured again.
Schwab’s in the cave with Abdul.”
</p>
<p>
“He’s light-headed, poor fellow!” said Mr.
Greatorex. “Here, some one, blankets, and
brandy—look <em>alive</em> now.”
</p>
<p>
Tom was soon stripped, dried, swathed in
warm blankets, and dosed with brandy till his
blood tingled. Mr. Greatorex fussed round
him, waiving his proffered explanations until
he was thoroughly recovered. Then Tom gave
him an account of all that had happened since
he left the yacht, Mr. Greatorex breaking in
every now and then with “Dear, dear!” “You
don’t <em>say</em> so!” “The villains!” “What a
<em>mercy</em>!” and such like exclamations. Early
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
in the narrative he interrupted with a question:
</p>
<p>
“You say Oliphant! Who’s Oliphant? Am
I on my <em>head</em> or my <em>heels</em>?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I forgot you didn’t know,” said Tom
with a smile. “Your new stoker was Oliphant
in disguise. You see, Byles, your late stoker,
had to remain at home and attend to his sick
mother.”
</p>
<p>
“No more sick than I am!” declared Mr.
Greatorex. “Don’t believe he <em>had</em> a mother!
M’Cracken, indeed! I’ll M’Cracken him! I
hope his father will get him well <em>thrashed</em> when
he goes back to school.”
</p>
<p>
“He’s rather big for that, don’t you think?”
</p>
<p>
“The bigger the better! I never <em>heard</em> of
such a thing! The impudence of it! And
taking us all <em>in</em> so! What things are coming to
I don’t know. No obedience, no respect for
age—pretending to be Scotch, too——”
</p>
<p>
“Well, he is Scotch, you know.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t tell <em>me</em>! He’s only Scotch when it
suits him. There are others like him in the
Lords. He was never Scotch in <em>my</em> house—where
he shall never show his face again, <em>never</em>!”
</p>
<p>
Tom was not deceived by this explosion of
wrath. He knew very well that Mr. Greatorex
was only relieving the tension of his feelings,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
and working off his nervous excitability on the
most convenient object. “Les absents ont toujours
tort,” he remembered. Mr. Greatorex
presently calmed down, and heard the rest of
the story in comparative quietude.
</p>
<p>
“And what are we to <em>do</em>?” he said at the close.
“Swob doesn’t matter; we’re not bound to
lift a finger for <em>him</em>; but we can’t leave Ingleton
and M’C—— and Oliphant in the hands of those
wretches. They’ll break up our machine, too,
and play the very deuce with <em>my property</em>.
What are we to <em>do</em>?”
</p>
<p>
What Tom answered is shown by subsequent
events. Two or three hours after his return
to the yacht, when he had had a thorough rest and
a good meal, a well-armed party, consisting of
the whole ship’s company except the cook and
one seaman, left the yacht, on which all lights
had been extinguished, and rowed with muffled
oars to a sheltered cove on the south side of the
bay—that furthest removed from the Arab
encampment. Mr. Greatorex had insisted on
joining the party. In vain Tom pointed out
that a hard march was before them, suggesting
delicately that Mr. Greatorex was not so
light as he once was. The merchant puffed the
objection away. They disembarked in dead
silence, and, leaving two of their number to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
take the boat back to the yacht, made their way
cautiously up the cliff.
</p>
<p>
Led by Tom, the party, ten in all, struck off
in the direction of the village. Thanks to the
light of the moon, which now lay a little above
the horizon, Tom was able to make a fairly
straight course for the plantation in which he
had hidden during the previous day. Once or
twice he strayed from the proper track, and
ultimately found that he was nearly a mile from
his objective; but this was not bad, considering
that there was no beaten road, and they had to
tramp across rough country. When he reached
the plantation he was no longer in doubt as
to the true direction; during his long stay
among the trees he had had time to take his
bearings pretty thoroughly.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Greatorex was blown by the time they
came to the clearing in which the airship had
descended, and Tom begged him to remain
hidden in the plantation while the rest went on
to the village.
</p>
<p>
“Pff!” panted the perspiring old gentleman.
“Never gave up <em>anything</em> yet; on you
go!”
</p>
<p>
But a slight halt was made while Tom completed
arrangements for his night raid. The village
was walled; the gates would no doubt be shut,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
as at Ain Afroo; the wall must be scaled. Captain
Bodgers selected the biggest men to give
their more active comrades a “leg-up.” These
latter were provided with ropes, by which they
might haul up the others when they had themselves
gained a footing on the wall. Tom
impressed on them all the necessity of maintaining
dead silence. He estimated that the village
contained about a hundred fighting men, and
if the approach of the raiders were discovered
in time for the walls to be manned, the chance of a
successful coup would be small indeed.
</p>
<p>
All carried firearms except Mr. Greatorex.
He had a knobbed stick, capable of dealing a
very damaging blow.
</p>
<p>
“There’s bound to be a <em>fight</em>, I suppose?”
he had said when Tom was discussing his plans
on the yacht. “I don’t like <em>that</em>, you know.
I’d punch a man’s nose and knock him down
without scruple, of course; but that needn’t
<em>kill</em> him, you know. Besides, how do I <em>stand</em>?
This is uncommonly like a piratical raid—like
Jameson’s, and he might have been <em>hanged</em>.
However!”
</p>
<p>
Tom assured him that no blood should be shed
if it could possibly be avoided; but he had small
hopes that the night would end without a fight,
and a very brisk one.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
</p>
<p>
The party set off for the village, stealing along
under what cover was afforded by bushes and
inequalities in the ground. When about three
hundred yards from the wall all such protection
ceased; the ground was level and apparently
open. Tom’s heart was in his mouth lest their
footsteps should be heard as they crossed this.
He dared not set them at a run, for the soil all
around was stony, and the sound of near a dozen
men rushing at speed could not fail to be heard
in the village. So he kept up the same stealthy
approach, and his caution was justified, for level
as the space had appeared at a distance, it proved
to have patches of loose stones, and some yards
of boggy land, through which ran a narrow and
evil-smelling creek; to rush would have ended in
disaster.
</p>
<p>
They arrived beneath the wall without having
heard any alarm raised within. In a trice the
men began to clamber up. It was made of mud
and rubble, and was not in so ruinous a condition
as the wall of Ain Afroo. The first man reached
the top. Immediately there was a shout and
the sound of hurrying feet, and Tom sprang
up to the sailor’s side in time to see a Moor in
long djellab dashing from the nearest house
towards the wall. Suddenly he halted, and
fired. The young sailor winced as the bullet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
struck him; but he was not badly hurt, and
letting down his rope, calmly proceeded to haul
up one of his comrades. After firing, the Moor
made a rush along the wall. Tom grappled
with him; both fell, dropping their weapons,
and Tom felt in an instant that he was no match
for the sinewy figure that had him in his arms.
The Moor forced him down; his hands were
already at Tom’s throat, when Timothy Ball,
who had accompanied the party in spite of his
half-healed wound, threw himself upon the
enemy from behind, dragged him backwards,
and left him half-strangled, but yet alive.
</p>
<p>
When Tom rose dizzily to his feet, all his party
were within the wall. One or two shouts were
heard from the village, but apparently the Moors
were not yet quite awake to what was happening.
Tom pulled himself together, and led the way
straight for the kasbah, which, from his lofty
perch in the tree during the day, he had seen
slightly to the right of the place at which the
entry into the village had been made. When
they dashed up to the main gate, this was being
opened to give exit to a couple of men who were
apparently about to inquire into the cause of the
slight commotion and the rifle shot that had
been heard. The two were instantly bowled
over by the onrush of British seamen, the party
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
swarmed through into the kasbah, the gate was
shut, and they came face to face with the head-man.
</p>
<p>
“What have you—got to—<em>say</em> for yourself?”
</p>
<p>
The Moor had naturally nothing to say for
himself. He saw himself confronted by an
elderly whiskered foreigner, in a yachting cap
and blue serge suit, brandishing a formidable
stick. Mr. Greatorex was in a passion. The
exertions of the march, the pains of being hauled
up a wall, not without bumps, the scamper at
the rear of his men into the Moor’s kasbah,
had deprived him equally of breath and of self-control.
Determined not to be left ignominiously
out of the hurly-burly, he forced himself to the
front, and thrust his stick under the very nose
of the Moor—who stood a foot above him—calling
him to account in the spluttering sentence
recorded above.
</p>
<p>
For a few moments there was a deadlock, and
Tom felt the need of an interpreter. Eventually
he persuaded Mr. Greatorex to give way, and
managed to make the Moor understand that
if he valued his life he must at once bring out the
Firangi whom he had recently introduced to
his house. Finding himself shut off by the gate
of his own kasbah from the support of his men,
the Moor recognized that he had no choice but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
to comply, and at a command from him one of
his servants brought Sir Mark Ingleton and
Oliphant from the upper floor into the patio,
looking none the worse for their brief incarceration.
</p>
<p>
“<em>Delighted</em> to see you,” said Mr. Greatorex,
stepping forward and wringing the diplomatist’s
hand; Oliphant he studiously ignored.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Greatorex, I presume,” returned Sir
Mark. “I hope to make your better acquaintance,
sir. Meanwhile, if I may be allowed——”
</p>
<p>
His quick eye had taken in the situation at a
glance.
</p>
<p>
“Peace be with thee!” he said in Arabic,
turning with a bland smile to the scowling Moor,
“You perceive, O Salaam, that my friends also,
being alarmed at my absence, have availed themselves
of your generous hospitality. They are
distressed at the unceremonious manner of their
entry, but you will assuredly deign to pardon it,
for have you not professed yourself my devoted
servant? You will be the first to forgive an
intrusion due solely to the too great zeal of my
friends.”
</p>
<p>
The Moor, chagrined and bewildered, had
no option but to acquiesce in this polite fiction,
though it is to be feared his reply lacked something
of the diplomatist’s ease and suavity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
</p>
<p>
“But we are a large company,” Sir Mark
went on, “and should be loth to trespass on
your hospitality. You will be relieved, I am
sure, if we betake ourselves to the vessel that
awaits us off your coast. You will, of course,
honour us by giving us your company so far.
Indeed, if you will do us the favour to accompany
us on board our vessel, we shall endeavour
to return in some slight measure the gracious
hospitality that has been vouchsafed to myself
and—my son. If you add to your favours by
assisting us in the march—by showing us the
easiest road and defending us from the perils
that may beset us, such as are known to you, O
Salaam—you may be assured that we shall show
our gratitude in very tangible form. There
are, as you know, even in Morocco, evil counsellors,
men of violence, some who would even dare
to lift their hands against the Sultan himself. If
there be any such in this village, which truly I
am loth to believe, I advise you, as brother
advises brother, to exhort them to mildness
of demeanour. These friends of mine who now
enjoy your hospitality are men of war; they
have arms, you perceive, in the use of which
they are well skilled; and since, in our progress
to the shore, you will of course occupy the place
of honour at my right hand, in all likelihood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
you would suffer hurt if there are among your
followers any men of Belial whose hearts incline
towards bloodshed; that would be a great grief
to us. And now, O Salaam, as the night draws
towards dawn, it will be well if you perform
your morning ablutions and devotions and prepare
to lead us forth. Bismillah!”
</p>
<p>
Sir Mark, as he laughingly informed Mr.
Greatorex afterwards, had purposely made his
address somewhat lengthy, so as to give Salaam
plenty of time to regain his self-possession and
to weigh the pros and cons. The upshot was
that, shortly after dawn, the whole party, with
Salaam son of Absalaam in their midst, set off
towards the coast, the airship being carried on
the shoulders of a troop of the villagers who had
been promised liberal bakshish in return for their
services.
</p>
<p>
On arriving at the shore, Captain Bodgers
signalled to his men on the yacht to send a boat,
and with it a fresh supply of fuel for the airship,
which had been deposited just above high-water
mark. While this was being done, Mr. Greatorex
emptied his pockets of small coin, to redeem
the promise to the carriers, and Sir Mark kept
up an even flow of amicable talk, apparently
quite oblivious of the throng of Arabs who had
observed the proceedings from their encampment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
on the cliff, and by and by came down to the
shore and stood around, listening with looks of
amazement to this fluent Nazarene who discoursed
so pleasantly of things intimate to
them.
</p>
<p>
The men soon arrived with a large tin of the
fuel-paste. It was placed in the car; Tom
made an inspection of the machinery to assure
himself that it had suffered no hurt while in the
charge of Salaam; then Oliphant joined him.
A few moments later, with a mighty whirring
sound, the airship rose gallantly into the air, to
the great wonderment of the Moors. While
they were intently watching the manœuvres of
the airship, filling the air with their cries of
“Mashallah!” Sir Mark and the rest of the party
embarked and pulled out into the bay, two of the
men sitting in the stern of the boat with their
faces to the shore and their rifles held conspicuously
ready. Salaam indulged in a burst of fury
at the manner in which he had been outwitted.
His followers gathered around him and held
excited consultation, some being apparently
inclined to fire on the departing boat, others
to pursue the airship. But they had made up
their minds to neither course by the time the
party reached the yacht; and when Captain
Bodgers trained on them the two brass guns
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
she carried, they hurriedly broke up and disappeared
over the cliffs.
</p>
<p>
“You were just in time, Mr. Greatorex,”
said Sir Mark Ingleton as they sat together in
the boat. “A messenger came in from the
sheikh yesterday afternoon, and I shrewdly suspect
that arrangements had been made to transfer us
to our old quarters in the kasbah. I say ‘our
old quarters,’ forgetting that Mr. Oliphant——”
</p>
<p>
“Oliphant!” interrupted Mr. Greatorex.
“<em>There</em> now! What do you think of <em>this</em>, Sir
Mark?”
</p>
<p>
And he proceeded to delight his guest with
a vigorous indictment of M’Cracken, and Byles,
and Byles’ sick mother, and Lord Langside for
having sent an English gentleman on a mission to
such an abominable country, and for having
such an outrageously impudent son.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV—THE TROGLODYTES</h2>
<p>
Meanwhile, how had things been faring
with Herr Hildebrand Schwab, the
unlucky representative of the Schlagintwert
Company of Düsseldorf and the partner of Sir
Mark’s captivity?
</p>
<p>
When Abdul pointed out the cave in which
it was advisable that they should take shelter,
and the means of access to it, Schwab groaned
deeply, and declared that nothing on earth should
induce a German subject of his weight to attempt
so perilous a climb. But on reflection he came
to look upon it as the lesser of two evils, and with
much travailing of spirit and discomfiture of body
he allowed himself to be assisted up the incline
so long as progress on foot was possible, and then
to be hoisted at the end of the rope. Abdul’s
strength alone would not have sufficed to haul
so great a mass into safety; but Salathiel ben
Ezra, who was by this time thoroughly weary of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
solitude, and had come to the end of his stock of
provisions, lent willing help, with a view, as it
proved, of turning the situation to account.
</p>
<p>
He used every means of persuasion and cajolery
which his ingenuity could devise to persuade Abdul
to release him. One of his propositions was that
they should convey the German to the sheikh of Ain
Afroo and claim a sufficient reward. Abdul ridiculed
the idea. Both he and the Jew would get
short shrift from the sheikh now that the more
valuable of his captives was snatched from his grasp.
Salathiel then proposed that they should try to gain
the nearest town where they might find Europeans,
and tell a moving story of the sufferings
and perils they had endured in rescuing the
German from the hands of his captors. But to
this, as to his other suggestions, Abdul turned a
deaf ear.
</p>
<p>
They were a strangely assorted trio. Schwab
only half trusted the Moor; the Moor despised
Schwab; both disliked the Jew. It was not
long before Schwab declared that he was hungry,
and illustrated the privations he had already
suffered by exhibiting the unwonted gap between
his waistcoat and his person: “And I have ze
straps of my vaistcoat drawn <em>so</em> tight!” he added.
Salathiel’s scanty stock of provisions having been
exhausted, Abdul descended to forage, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
returned with a supply of dates and olives, and
the tin filled with water at the spring.
</p>
<p>
“Ach! My pipe! It is in ze room vere
first I vas laid up. Mein Gott! And ze list of
Schlagintwert; ze last edition, revise and enlarge.
Ze Moors zey vill now order vizout me, and I
lose colossal sum in commission!”
</p>
<p>
All this was Greek to Abdul, but a little more
comprehensible to the Jew, with whom, however,
Schwab refused to discuss business. He preferred
to ply Abdul diligently with questions
about the airship: where it came from; how
it was driven; what was the composition of the
fuel.
</p>
<p>
“Already is it partly known to me,” he said.
“It contain large quantity Photographic Sensitizer
Preparation Number Six. But zat is not
all. I know it! Vy? Because my Jarman
intellex tell me so. But vizout doubt I discover
it; zen zere shall be business for Schlagintwert.
You do not know vat ze ozer zink is?”
</p>
<p>
Abdul shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“Zen you vas never made for business. Vun
cannot learn it; it is born. So vas I born!”
</p>
<p>
He discoursed on business and other things,
despising his audience for their want of appreciation;
then fell to bemoaning his fate. Thus
the hours passed away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
</p>
<p>
At last the monotony of the situation was
broken. Abdul, like a good Mohammedan, was
engaged in his devotions when the Jew, at the
mouth of the cave, caught sight of a party of
Moors far below, and signalled to them before
he could be prevented. Springing up, Abdul
was on the point of killing him with his knife
when Schwab hastily interposed.
</p>
<p>
“No, I vill not have it,” he said. “You kill
him; zen am I accomplice; and vat is zat for
a kind of business, I say?”
</p>
<p>
But he did not decline to assist Abdul to truss
up the Jew and render him incapable of further
mischief. No more than Abdul himself did he
wish to attract visitors.
</p>
<p>
The mischief, however, was already done.
The Moors, a search party despatched by the
sheikh, had observed the Jew’s signals, and at once
spurred their horses across the country until
they reached the foot of the precipitous ascent.
They dismounted: one of them began to climb
up. For a time Abdul watched his progress;
then, when he thought the man had mounted
far enough, he threatened to hurl him from the
face of the cliff if he advanced another step
upwards. It was so obviously in Abdul’s power
to make good his threat that the Moor hesitated;
then, in response to an encouraging shout from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
below, he again began to climb. He may have
reflected that his comrades could afford to shout;
they were not clinging like a fly to the face of
an almost perpendicular wall of rock; but he
may have reflected also that great would be his
praise and reward if he succeeded in bringing to
account the insolent strangers who had done
such despite to his sheikh. No doubt also he
reckoned on support from the member of the
party who had signalled.
</p>
<p>
Up he came, slowly feeling his way. Abdul
bent over the brink, and, just as the man ascended
within reach, smartly rapped his knuckles with the
butt of Tom’s revolver. At the same moment
a shot from below struck the rock within an
inch of his head. Abdul at once darted back
within the shelter of the cave; but the climber,
taught by the sharp blow he had received,
ventured no farther, and shortly afterwards began
to descend. When he reached the party below,
it was clear that he met with a reprimand from
the leader for his want of courage; but he
sullenly refused to make another attempt, and
seemed by his gesticulations to invite each of his
comrades in turn to take his place. But nobody
came forward, and after an excited discussion—portions
of which were in tones so loud that
Abdul was able to interpret to Schwab, nervously
eager to learn what was to be done—a messenger
was sent off in the direction of Ain Afroo, while
the five or six who remained settled down to
keep watch at the foot of the precipice.

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span></div>
<p>
Rather more than an hour passed. Schwab
became more and more anxious. At last a much
larger party rode down at a gallop, among them
the sheikh himself. Raising his voice when he
came below the cave, he called on the occupants
to surrender, threatening them with the most
fearful tortures if they persisted in defying him.
It was evident from the terms he used that he
was under the impression that his escaped
prisoners and their rescuers were all in the cave
together, and thus that he had them fairly trapped.
Abdul made the most of this mistake. He
warned the sheikh against braving the power of
the white man. He had already had one example
of it; the Firangi had shown him more mercy
than he deserved; the second example would
entail dire consequences on himself and his
village. But this reply only fanned the flames
of the sheikh’s wrath; he was not to be intimidated
by words: and, hurling more threats, he
began to consult with his followers as to some
means of enforcing his summons.
</p>
<p>
It was clearly a hazardous if not indeed an
impossible task to approach the cave from below.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
One man in the cave, so long as he kept himself
out of range of rifle fire, could hold any number
at bay. How much more, then, would it be
disastrous to make the attempt against, as the
sheikh supposed, five or six well-armed men?
But, as Abdul well knew, it was just possible to
gain the plateau above the cave, from which
access to it could be obtained, by climbers acting
in concert on the eastern face of the hill. That
this longer but easier ascent would be known to
the enemy there was no doubt, for Abdul had
just recognized, among the horsemen who had
accompanied the sheikh, a young man who had
been his companion in former days, and with
whom as a boy he had actually performed the
feat.
</p>
<p>
Anxiously he watched the colloquy below.
Behind, Schwab was imploring him to explain
what the sheikh had said. It turned out as he
had feared. His former companion with a few
others left the sheikh and disappeared; the rest
made themselves comfortable within a few yards
of the foot of the hill. Abdul had little doubt
that he would soon have to reckon with an attack
from above; not an easy matter, in truth, but
far more likely to succeed than any attempt from
below.
</p>
<p>
There was a long interval. Under stress of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
fear and hunger, Schwab was nearly demented.
He walked about the cave, with his hands pressed
hard upon the neighbourhood of the lowest
button of his waistcoat, uttering guttural groans,
making lugubrious appeals to the Homeland, and
to a lady whom he called at one time Mrs. Bottle,
at another “mein briddy Chain,” and ever and
anon anathematizing Thomas Dorrell, “vat do
nozink for me—for me, vat do so much for him
viz Photographic Sensitizer Preparation Number
Six.” Abdul paid no heed to the German’s
fumings and frettings, nor to the entreaties of
Salathiel ben Ezra, who, stretched on his back,
tied hand and foot, added to his prayers the most
lavish promises if the Moor would only release
him and help him to return to his own place.
</p>
<p>
At last, Abdul, squatting silent and watchful
just within the opening of the cave, saw a pair of
legs dangling in front of him. Some of the
enemy had, as he had foreseen, made their way
to the top of the hill, and were about to attempt
to reach the cave from above. It was a foolhardy
proceeding, for they could only come singly,
and the occupants of the cave could easily dispose
of them. Indeed, Abdul surmised that the
sheikh was trying an experiment, sending one
of his men to draw the badger. However that
may have been, the application of the point of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
Abdul’s knife to the calf of one of the dangling
legs caused the owner of them to draw them
hastily up and to swarm up the rope to which
he was clinging, as a spider runs up his filmy
thread when threatened by an enemy.
</p>
<p>
Apparently the sheikh was satisfied that a
direct assault, whether from above or below,
was hopeless, for thenceforth the cave party were
left in peace. But it was peace only externally.
Even Abdul himself, who had hitherto preserved
extraordinary composure, now showed signs of
perturbation. What was the enemy doing?
He dared not attempt to see, for he knew that
if he showed his head it would be the target for
a dozen bullets. Did the sheikh intend to starve
them out? Their food was all gone; the
tin of water was almost empty; it was impossible
to get a fresh supply of either. Voices were
heard from below; once Abdul heard an answering
call from above; it appeared indeed as if
the sheikh had resolved on an investment, knowing
that sooner or later the occupants of the cave
must yield or die.
</p>
<p>
The day passed. Schwab fell into a sleep of
exhaustion. Abdul remained sleepless, wondering
why the Englishman had not reappeared with
the airship, as he had said he would do. Had
some mishap befallen him? Surely he had not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
wilfully deserted them! This Abdul refused
to believe. When morning broke he ventured to
go to the mouth of the cave and look out. The
Moors were still below; apparently they had
camped all night on the ground. They caught
sight of Abdul, and mockingly invited him to
share their cous-cousoo. He made no reply,
and again withdrew into the shadow.
</p>
<p>
Schwab was by this time a wreck. He lay
silent. From the back of the cave came piteous
moans from Salathiel, begging to be relieved of
his bonds. But Abdul was obdurate; he had
enough to do to keep watch on the enemy in
front, without having to reckon with the Jew
besides, for he knew that Salathiel would stick
at no treachery.
</p>
<p>
Impassive as Abdul appeared, he was in reality
on the verge of despair. The time was fast
approaching when he must choose between
starvation and surrender. The choice did not
trouble him; he would never surrender to the
sheikh of Ain Afroo. What troubled him was
the thought that his old enemy would once more
triumph; that the vengeance on which he had
set his whole mind for years was to be snatched
from him.
</p>
<p>
He was bitterly thinking on these things when
Schwab rose feebly to his feet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
</p>
<p>
“I can no more,” he said; “I go to yield
myself. I muss have somezink to eat. Still
am I Jarman sobjeck; zey vill respeck our Kaiser
who is in Berlin.”
</p>
<p>
Abdul expostulated, striving in his imperfect
English to warn the German of the risk he ran.
He knew the sheikh; he was a terrible enemy;
he would care nothing who or what his prisoner
was. Who in Europe would be any the wiser
if in this remote mountainous region a man were
slowly done to death in the dungeons of a kasbah?
But Schwab would not listen; he craved for
food; “Let us eat, for to-morrow we die,”
exactly expresses his state of mind. He moved
towards the entrance to the cave, shaking off,
with a sudden access of rage, Abdul’s detaining
hand. The Moor followed him, and stood
behind him when Schwab, at the brink of the
precipice, waved his hand and shouted—
</p>
<p>
“I give myself opp. But you muss come and
fetch me.”
</p>
<p>
But before the echo of his voice had died away,
Abdul suddenly pulled him back by main force
into the cave.
</p>
<p>
“See! see!” he cried.
</p>
<p>
“Tausend Teufel! Vat shall I see?” returned
Schwab.
</p>
<p>
At the point where Abdul now stood the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
country immediately beneath the cave was
invisible, and both the men were screened from
the Moors. But the sky was open, and far away
in the clear blue to the north-west Abdul had
descried a speck which moment by moment was
growing larger.
</p>
<p>
“Vat shall I see?” repeated Schwab, vainly
looking in the direction of Abdul’s stretched
forefinger.
</p>
<p>
“The flying ship!” cried Abdul. “It comes!”
</p>
<p>
“You say zat! Lemme see, lemme see, lemme
see!”
</p>
<p>
He roofed his eyes with his hands, and peered
into the distance.
</p>
<p>
“Ach! zey veep!” he said, rubbing away the
tears that had gathered. “It is for vant of food,
nozink else.”
</p>
<p>
He looked again.
</p>
<p>
“Boy, you are right!” he exclaimed, “truly
it is ze airship. Zey come for me! Ach! you
dirty Moors, now you may go choke! I vizdraw
vat I said about give myself opp. I vas not
myself; I vas—I vas—anozer man. Ach, boy,
so am I indeed hungry!”
</p>
<p>
The two watched the airship drawing nearer.
For a moment Abdul wondered whether it would
come into any danger from the rifles of the Moors
either below or on the hilltop above. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
remembering how clearly everything on the
ground could be seen from the car of the airship,
he was reassured, guessing that Tom would
descry the besiegers in plenty of time to avoid
their shots.
</p>
<p>
To gain the hilltop the airship had approached
at a considerable altitude, but was now dropping.
About half a mile from the cave it suddenly
made an upward sweep, and Abdul knew that
the enemy had been seen. Before it sailed out
of sight over the hill, Abdul plucked off his
djellab, and waved it in the mouth of the cave.
The signal provoked two or three shots from
those of the Moors below whose attention was
not engrossed by the machine, which some of
them had seen before and of which all had heard
most marvellous accounts. Abdul was unhurt,
and his signal was answered by a shot from the
car of the airship, which then passed out of sight.
</p>
<p>
“Famos! Zey know ve are still alive! Mein
Gott! truly mein hunger is colossal.”
</p>
<p>
Tom had in point of fact discovered the enemy
at the moment when Abdul noticed the change
in the direction of the airship. The discovery
was by no means a welcome one.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t reckon on their hiding-place being
found out,” he said to Oliphant. “It makes
things rather awkward.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
</p>
<p>
“They must be in a pretty bad state in the
cave if the Moors have been here long.”
</p>
<p>
“And we can’t get at them; we daren’t go too
near, for at close quarters the Moors would
riddle the planes with their shot and very likely
smash the engines. And we certainly can’t
let the airship down and go for them. The
worst of it is, they know pretty well by this time
what the airship really is, and we couldn’t throw
them into a panic as we did before.”
</p>
<p>
“Confound this German!” said Oliphant.
“I shouldn’t mind if we could have a really good
scrimmage and some fun for our money, but
there’s nothing in it.”
</p>
<p>
“There’s Abdul, you see,” replied Tom.
“We’ll have to think it out. They’re in the
cave, safe enough, and can evidently hold on there.
Let us make for that hill yonder, and think the
matter out.”
</p>
<p>
As the airship crossed the hill of the cave,
Tom steering for the loftier hill some five miles
to the east, a dozen Moors sprang to their saddles
and set off in pursuit. But the ground was
very rough; they had to follow a tortuous route;
and when, a few minutes later, the airship reached
the hill, Tom calculated that he had probably
half-an-hour to spare before the horsemen would
arrive.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
</p>
<p>
“We’d better ground, and economize fuel,”
he said. “’Pon my word, Oliphant, it seems as
if this is going to be as tough a job as it was at
the kasbah.”
</p>
<p>
Choosing a fairly open space almost at the
top of the hill, Tom brought the machine to
earth. Then, while Oliphant watched for signs
of the pursuing horsemen, Tom stretched himself
on his back, with his hands under his head and his
cap tilted over his eyes, and settled down to a
good hard think.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t go to sleep,” said Oliphant.
</p>
<p>
Tom replied with a grunt.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span><a name='chXV' id='chXV'></a>CHAPTER XV—VIEW HALLOO!</h2>
<p>
Oliphant sat with his knees up, looking at
his friend, thinking what a cool hand he was.
No one could have guessed from Tom’s easy
attitude that he was thinking out a problem on
which lives depended. As the minutes passed,
even Oliphant was deceived.
</p>
<p>
“Not asleep, Dorrell?”
</p>
<p>
Tom grunted, but did not stir. Another
minute or two, then he suddenly jumped up.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I think I’ve got it,” he said, and he
chuckled.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?”
</p>
<p>
“Come along. I’ll explain as we go.”
</p>
<p>
The two mounted the car; Tom started the
ascensional screws; and the airship rose slowly
from the hill. When they had left the ground
some three hundred feet beneath them they
saw, a mile or more distant, the body of horsemen
who had set off in pursuit from the Moors’
encampment. The airship was headed in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
direction from which they had come, and when
they saw it they halted, and waited until it had
soared past them; then, having no doubt that
it was returning to the hill with the intention
of again attempting to rescue the blockaded men,
they wheeled round, and galloped in pursuit.
</p>
<p>
The airship was going at only a moderate speed,
so that the horsemen were able to keep pace
with it. Tom chuckled again, and Oliphant,
to whom he had by this time imparted his notion,
seemed to find great amusement in the sight.
</p>
<p>
“The beggars little imagine they’re playing
our game,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“No, indeed. I wonder what they really
are thinking. Probably they fancy something
has gone wrong with our works and we can’t go
any faster.”
</p>
<p>
“D’you think they’ve got wind of our former
breakdown?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s not unlikely. News travels very fast in
these countries that haven’t got the telegraph!”
</p>
<p>
When they arrived at the hill of the caves,
there appeared to be no change in the situation.
A small group of four or five men were squatting
on the summit; more than a score were congregated
below. All eyes were directed upwards
as the airship again came into view, and the
men laughed, recognizing how fruitless would be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
any renewed attempt to rescue the prisoners.
They all carried rifles, and evidently intended
to use them when the vessel came within range.
But it passed too high above their heads, still
going very slowly, and, so far from descending
towards the cave, sailed on towards the sea. It
crossed one of the adjacent hills, then sank a little,
so that it was only visible then to the few men
who kept watch above.
</p>
<p>
But a minute or two afterwards the occupants
of the car, looking round, saw that these men
were on their feet, gesticulating with great
excitement.
</p>
<p>
“They’ve taken the bait!” cried Oliphant,
laughing outright.
</p>
<p>
The men had noticed that the airship, instead
of continuing its north-westerly course, had
suddenly taken a turn to the left, and was making
at tremendous speed straight for the village
of Ain Afroo. Rising higher into the air, so
that he could get a view over the shoulder of
the hill, Tom saw that the whole body of horsemen,
now joined by the sheikh and his party,
were riding at a mad gallop for the village. By
this time the airship was a mile ahead of them,
and the two Englishmen laughed heartily as
they watched the frantic efforts of the Moors to
reduce the gap. They were left hopelessly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
behind, and were still more than a mile from
the walls when the airship, hovering directly
over the roof of the kasbah, began very slowly
to drop earthwards as if a descent were going
to be made on the spot where it had formerly
rested.
</p>
<p>
The descent took a considerable time. Who
was there to tell the frenzied horsemen that
the accursed Firangi was playing with them?
They urged their foaming steeds up the hill
at a furious rate, making light of all obstacles,
and extorting a tribute of admiration from the
Englishmen for horses and riders alike. They
clattered into the village, dashed through the
street, pulled the horses up on their haunches at
the door of the kasbah, flung themselves from
the saddles, and poured into the patio and up the
stairs.
</p>
<p>
The sheikh himself, by far the best mounted
of the troop, was the first to arrive; and within
a few seconds he sprang out of the opening on
the roof, followed closely by several members of
his household. But what was this? The airship,
instead of resting on the flagged roof, was
hundreds of feet above them, and, horror of
horrors! sailing with terrific speed back towards
the hill of the caves. For a few moments the
Moors stood gazing in bewilderment, being
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
joined by more men from below. Then, with
hearty Moslem curses, they rushed back to the
opening, toppling over one another, stumbling
down the stairs in their haste. Down into the
patio, out of the gate, on to their horses’ backs
once more, and off they set, pell-mell after the
airship.
</p>
<p>
But the horses were badly blown. There were
four miles of heavy country to cover. And by
the time they were again clear of the walls the
airship was halfway to the hill.
</p>
<p>
Tom and his friend were hugely delighted
with the success of their simple bit of strategy.
They could see the horsemen like ants in the
distance beneath, urging their poor panting horses
to the utmost of their capacity.
</p>
<p>
“We ought to have plenty of time to get
them away,” said Tom.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but hang it all! we’ve clean forgotten
that we can’t lift both Schwab and the Moor.”
</p>
<p>
“Great Scott!” Tom ejaculated, in consternation.
But in a moment his face cleared. “We’ll
manage that,” he said cheerfully. But then
he received another shock. He saw that the
four or five men who had held their watch on
the plateau were still there: they had not followed
the rest. Their horses could be seen
tethered in the grove beneath, and the men were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
gathered in a knot, watching the rapid approach
of the machine, which probably they had expected
to see no more.
</p>
<p>
“There’s only one thing for it,” said Tom.
“We must go slap at them, and trust to luck.
If they shoot, they may do so before we are within
range, and at this speed they may easily miss us.
They are sure to be a bit nervous, too.”
</p>
<p>
Tom had already begun the descent, obliquely
upon the hill. When the airship was, as nearly
as he could calculate, on a level with the summit,
he again put the engines to their utmost speed,
and dashed straight at the little group. There
were three or four reports almost simultaneously,
and above the whirr of the screws Tom thought
he heard a sound of rending, as if one of the
planes had been struck by a bullet. The vessel,
indeed, dipped slightly, and for a moment he
feared that it would be dashed against the face
of the hill. But he jerked up the lever controlling
the planes, the airship rose the few feet
necessary to clear the summit, and once more
sped on its course.
</p>
<p>
By this time, however, the group on the hilltop
had taken fright. They could not know
that if the airship dashed into them, they would
be as formidable to it as it could be to them.
Even if they had known this, they would probably
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
not have been willing to sell their lives, even
though in doing so they should break up the
machine and hurl its occupants to destruction.
With one consent they broke and fled.
</p>
<p>
Tom instantly reversed the engines, and the
airship glided slowly to rest on the plateau.
But the path by which the fugitives were attempting
to make good their flight was only wide enough
to accommodate one man at a time, and that
with difficulty. Only three of the men had
begun to descend when Tom sprang out of the
car. The other two, fearing to be attacked
from behind, turned instinctively to meet the
supposed danger. Then, seeing that they had
only two men to deal with, and feeling no doubt
that they would be completely at the mercy of these
men when once they had begun the descent,
they hesitated for a second at the brink.
</p>
<p>
If they had used this second to draw their
formidable knives, Tom’s adventure might have
ended there and then, for in his eagerness he
had forgotten to snatch up his revolver. But
their halt was due rather to nervousness than
to courage, and Tom was never lacking in
promptitude at the critical moment. He dashed
straight at them. One of them swung round
at once and slithered down the path. The other,
somewhat more mettlesome, made a grab at his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
knife. But he had only half drawn it from his
belt when Tom’s fist shot out and tumbled him
headlong after his comrade. The result would
have been amusing if Tom had had time to
observe it. From top to bottom of that rocky
declivity there was an avalanche of Moors. The
impetus with which the topmost man had been
shot over the edge sent him smack into the man
next below. The two then rolled, or rather
pitched, on top of those who had preceded them,
and were making their way quickly yet laboriously
down the steep tracks, and it is to be feared that
there were bruised and broken limbs at the
bottom.
</p>
<p>
But Tom had neither eyes nor ears for the
discomfiture of his enemies. There was still
much to be done before he could be sure that
his friends and his airship were out of harm’s
way. One of his friends was already taking
things into his own hands. At the first hint of
what was happening Abdul had left the mouth
of the cave, and was now swarming up the perilous
face of the hillside. Breathless he came over
the brink, on the opposite side from that
where the Moors had disappeared, almost before
Tom could turn round.
</p>
<p>
“All well below?” asked Tom.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, master.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
</p>
<p>
“Can you bring up the big man?”
</p>
<p>
“With a rope, master.”
</p>
<p>
“Quick, then: we have no time to spare.”
</p>
<p>
“And the Hudi, master?”
</p>
<p>
“What of him?”
</p>
<p>
“He made them come. We tied him, feet
and hands.”
</p>
<p>
“Untie him, but leave him. He can make
them come again!”
</p>
<p>
A rope was quickly unshipped from the car
and strongly looped. Abdul descended, the
rope being held by both Oliphant and Tom
above, who, doubtful whether their strength
would stand the strain of the ponderous German’s
weight, hitched it round a rocky prominence
at the brink of the hill. But fear lent Schwab
extraordinary agility—as once before in the
enclosure of Midfont House. With the rope
looped about him, he hauled himself up by it,
assisting his progress with his feet against the
hill. He was in a bath of perspiration, his
fat face was pale as death, when he reached the
top and sank exhausted at Tom’s feet. Oliphant
and Tom together hoisted him into the car, and
by the time he was settled, Abdul had cut the
Jew’s bonds and again clambered up, pursued
by entreaties, wild threats, execrations, from
the luckless Salathiel ben Ezra.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
</p>
<p>
Glancing in the direction of Ain Afroo, Tom
rejoiced to see that he had still about ten minutes
to spare before the pursuing horsemen could
arrive at the spot. He knew from experience
that with Schwab as a passenger the ascensional
screws did not exert sufficient power to lift three
other men; but when Oliphant had reminded
him of this, a way out of the difficulty suggested
itself. If once the airship could be raised from
the ground and the horizontal screws set in
motion, it was likely that, with the speed thus
obtained, they might suffice (the planes being
inclined at the proper angle) to overcome the
downward pull of gravity.
</p>
<p>
Tom rapidly explained to Abdul the plan he
had formed. Then, entering the car in which
Schwab and Oliphant already were, he set the
ascensional screws in motion. The vessel slowly
rose. Meanwhile Abdul had looped about his
body the rope by which Schwab had been hauled
up, the upper end of which had again been
securely attached to the car. When the airship
had risen a few feet from the hill-top, Tom set
the horizontal engines at full speed, and the
vessel sailed beyond the plateau, Abdul dangling
from it at the end of the rope, as he had done
once before when rescued from the shark. He
showed no fear; in the loop he was perfectly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
safe, for even if the vessel sank with his weight,
it would be so slowly that he would run no risk
of being brought too violently into contact with
the ground.
</p>
<p>
As Tom had expected, the vessel did not sink.
But, the horizontal screws being partly engaged
in counteracting the force of gravity, the speed of
the airship was reduced to only five or six miles
an hour, and at that rate it was evident that the
fuel would not hold out until they reached the
coast. A second breakdown must be averted at
all costs; it was unlikely that they would be able
to escape the clutches of predatory Moors a
second time. No doubt the story of what had
happened before had spread for many miles
through the country, and short shrift would be
given to the aeronauts if again they were brought
to earth.
</p>
<p>
There was now only a minute or two to spare
before the sheikh would arrive. Whatever could
be done must be done at once. Glancing down,
Tom saw below him the horses belonging to the
men who had just been tumbled from the plateau.
The men themselves were lying at the foot of the
hill, not dead, as Tom was glad to see—the
rugged declivity had broken their fall—but
evidently completely disabled. Without hesitation
Tom reduced the speed of the engines
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
and descended, shouting to Abdul, who at the
end of the rope would of course reach the ground
first, to secure two of the best horses, and follow
as fast as he could in the track of the airship.
</p>
<p>
Owing to the delay that had occurred, Abdul
had only just leapt into the saddle when the
horsemen came into sight scarcely half a mile
away. The sheikh was far ahead of his men,
and the pace even of his splendid Arab showed
that there was little fear of Abdul being overtaken.
The young Moor set off at a gallop, a second
horse at his side. There was a shout behind
him; the sheikh called upon his followers to
spur their flagging steeds: clearly he intended
gamely to continue the pursuit.
</p>
<p>
But the fugitives were now well away. Tom
accommodated the speed of the airship to the
pace of the horses below, keeping at a height
of no more than a hundred feet from the ground
so as to be able to drop down and stand by Abdul
in case of need. For a few minutes it seemed
as though the lad was to be close pressed, in spite
of the hard galloping the horses of the pursuers
had already done. But gradually they dropped
farther and farther behind; Abdul’s horses
were fresh; he himself was a light weight; and
Tom began to breathe more freely.
</p>
<p>
Another danger, however, occurred to him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
The country was at present wild and desolate,
with no signs of habitation. But as he neared
the coast, he would undoubtedly pass scattered
villages and towns, and it was possible that Abdul
might be checked at one of these. He therefore
felt it desirable to rise to a greater height, so
that he might obtain a more extensive outlook
over the country and indicate to Abdul a course
which would prevent him from running into
danger.
</p>
<p>
He soon saw that his precaution was justified.
The pursuers were still sticking doggedly to the
trail, and Tom noticed that from time to time
they were joined by fresh horsemen from the
hamlets through which they passed. He could
not distinguish figures in the distance, but he
had no doubt that the sheikh had already obtained
a fresh horse, and was among a group which had
far outstripped the rest of the troop and was
gradually diminishing the distance between them
and their quarry. Abdul was riding gallantly
on, changing from horse to horse with admirable
dexterity; but it was clear that the pursuers,
with many opportunities of obtaining remounts,
must in course of time run him down. The
airship would always indicate the direction in
which they should ride.
</p>
<p>
Again Tom had to devise a means of overcoming a new
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
difficulty. The chase had now
lasted some hours, and the matter was becoming
urgent. By good luck, the sight of a high conical
hill, well wooded, somewhat to the right of the
course they had been following, suggested a
plan. Lowering the airship to within easy speaking
distance of the Moor—a manœuvre which
caused some uneasiness to his horses, tired as
they were—Tom directed him to make for this
hill, and remain in hiding among the trees until
rejoined. At the moment he thought of making
all speed to the yacht, dropping Schwab, replenishing
his can of fuel, and returning for Abdul.
But a little consideration caused him to change
his mind. It might prove a very difficult matter
to find the hill again when returning. It must
be, he guessed, at least sixty miles from the sea,
and he could not remember the landmarks
exactly enough to be able to retrace his
course.
</p>
<p>
In rapid consultation with Oliphant he decided
on another plan. Altering the course of the
airship several points to the southward, and keeping
a sharp lookout upon the pursuers, he found
that they were still following him as a guide.
No longer having to consider the powers of
endurance of Abdul’s horses, he quickened the
speed of the airship, and saw in a little while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
that this had had its effect, several of the horsemen
beginning to straggle, though they all
continued in the same direction. Having thus
taken the enemy some five or six miles out of their
course, he suddenly swung round and made off
at full speed towards the hill where he had left
Abdul, of which he had been careful not to lose
sight.
</p>
<p>
“They are a game lot,” remarked Oliphant,
as the horsemen again followed the track. They
were soon left mere specks on the horizon, and
at last dropped entirely out of sight. Approaching
the hill from another side, some time elapsed
before the airship was seen by Abdul from his
concealment in the wood. Then he again
mounted; his horses had profited by the short
rest: and the fugitives, having gained several
miles by Tom’s manœuvre, were able to take
matters comparatively easy until late in the
afternoon.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span><a name='chXVI' id='chXVI'></a>CHAPTER XVI—ICARUS</h2>
<p>
Meanwhile Schwab had awoke to the
facts of existence, and the manner in
which he announced his awakening was characteristic.
</p>
<p>
“Himmel! how I am hungry!”
</p>
<p>
“Hullo, Mr. Schwab! Feel better?” said
Tom, throwing a hasty glance at the German
lying against the rail.
</p>
<p>
“Vorse! vorse! Tousand times vorse!”
</p>
<p>
Oliphant laughed at his hollow tones.
</p>
<p>
“It is nozink for to laugh,” returned Schwab
with a flicker of animation. “I am vizout food,
I know not how many hours. It is not viz me
custom to go so long vizout food; it give me
rude pain—zere!”
</p>
<p>
He laid his hand on the lowest button of his
waistcoat.
</p>
<p>
“No longer am I as I vas. Vunce I swell, not
too moch, but all ober; now, I fade, I shrink,
I have to get ze tailor to take me in.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
</p>
<p>
“Awful, for a business man,” said Oliphant—“to
be taken in, you know.”
</p>
<p>
“So! But it muss be done. Ach! I am
hungry as a—as a—as a——”
</p>
<p>
“Hunter!” suggested Oliphant.
</p>
<p>
“No; hungry as a rhinoceros. I could eat—I
could eat—I could eat a——”
</p>
<p>
“Whale!”
</p>
<p>
“No; I could eat a steak, underdone, from
ze grill, viz chip bodadoes, gabbage viz vinegar,
and Voosder sauce, viz a long glass—ach! two
long glasses, of lager from München. Ach!
ze zought of it make my mous cry.”
</p>
<p>
“For goodness’ sake, Oliphant, give him some
grub and shut his mouth,” cried Tom.
</p>
<p>
“Shut my mous? How zen can I eat? For
ze sake of anyzink give me somezink to eat; zen
my mous vill shut and open of itself; vun needs
not to zink ven one eats.”
</p>
<p>
Bubbling with amusement, Oliphant handed
the German some biscuits from the stock they had
brought with them. But his mirth evaporated
when he caught sight of Tom’s face. He had
wondered a little at the tetchy tone in which
Tom had last addressed him, and from his anxious
expression he could not but guess that something
was seriously wrong.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter, Dorrell?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
</p>
<p>
“The engines—don’t you smell ’em?”
</p>
<p>
“I do,” replied Oliphant, sniffing. “What’s
it mean?”
</p>
<p>
“It means that the turbine casing is becoming
overheated. I altered the inlet valve so as to
let more of the explosive mixture into the turbine—and
this is the result.”
</p>
<p>
“What can we do?”
</p>
<p>
“Simply reduce speed and hope that we can
weather through.”
</p>
<p>
“Any idea how much farther we have to go?”
</p>
<p>
“About fifty miles, I should think. We must
have done forty at least. I shut off one of the
engines just now, but the second one can’t keep
us afloat. I wish Schwab would fade and shrink
into nothing.”
</p>
<p>
Schwab had heard nothing of this. He was
otherwise occupied. But noting now the anxious
looks of his two companions he said, with his
mouth full—“Do I eat too many?”
</p>
<p>
Tom was too much concerned to reply, but
Oliphant laughed again.
</p>
<p>
“We can’t go on,” said Tom. “I shall have
to drop her somewhere and see if I can put
matters right. We were five or six miles ahead
of the Moors when I caught sight of them last,
and we’ve a few minutes’ grace at any rate.
They won’t know exactly where we are.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>
</p>
<p>
Choosing a secluded spot, he descended and
brought the airship to rest. Abdul had halted;
Tom explained to him the cause of his descent,
and set him to keep watch on the enemy while
he examined the machinery. The Moor looked
thoroughly done up, and it struck Oliphant that
he was even more in need of food than Schwab,
so he gave him the remainder of the stock
of biscuits—not a large quantity now. As for
Schwab, he had fallen asleep.
</p>
<p>
It took Tom but a few minutes to adjust
the valve, but he knew that the result of this
adjustment must be a serious reduction of
speed. He was greatly perturbed. It was clearly
impossible for Abdul to ride much farther: the
horses were in a terrible state of exhaustion.
They were cropping the scanty herbage at the
side of the track—poor refreshment after the
fatigue they had undergone.
</p>
<p>
“The Moors’ horses must be equally played
out, that’s one comfort,” said Tom;—“at least,
those that have pursued us all the way, if any
have. That’s doubtful: the Moors have probably
drawn on every village they have come through.”
</p>
<p>
“I say, did you hear that?” asked Oliphant.
</p>
<p>
It was a shout—apparently from a spur of
forest some distance to the right of the line
which they had expected the enemy to take.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
</p>
<p>
“They’re spreading out! Who’d have thought
they’d have kept it up so long?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you see, they know that one of us is
on horseback: that means that the machine
won’t carry us all; and in the nature of things they
can overtake a rider.”
</p>
<p>
“I can see nothing for it but that Abdul must
push on alone,” said Tom. “We can manage
to get along slowly, and as long as the machine
can keep us afloat at all they can’t catch us. But
if they catch sight of Abdul he’s bound to be run
down. Abdul, you must go on by yourself.
Get to the coast if you can, and swim out to the
yacht—can you swim?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, master.”
</p>
<p>
“Swim to the yacht, then, and tell Mr.
Greatorex what has happened. He’ll do all he
can to help us if we can only get near enough.”
</p>
<p>
Abdul showed some reluctance to leave the
others in difficulties, but he obeyed. He mounted
the less exhausted of the horses and set off.
</p>
<p>
“He’ll have a chance,” remarked Tom, as he
disappeared. “When the Moors see us in the
air again they will suppose that Abdul is keeping
pace with us as before.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s nearly six o’clock; it’ll be dark soon.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, that gives him another chance—if they
don’t sight him.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>
</p>
<p>
At this moment he observed a score of horsemen
emerging at a rapid pace from the forest whence
the shout had come. They were about half a
mile away. Catching sight of the airship, they
gave utterance to loud cries of triumph, and
somewhat changed their direction. Tom at
once caused the airship to rise, and by the
time the Moors arrived at the spot where it had
rested it was high above their heads and out of
harm’s way.
</p>
<p>
The Moors immediately began to scour the
neighbourhood for signs of Abdul. Tom steered
slightly to the left of the direction in which the
lad had gone, in order still further to delude the
pursuers. Not long afterwards a much larger
band of riders galloped up from the direction
in which the airship had come, and when they
joined the former party, it was seen that they
numbered at least sixty in all.
</p>
<p>
“We’re rousing the whole country,” said
Tom with a return to his wonted cheerful manner.
“If it goes on like this there’ll be thousands by
the time we reach the coast.”
</p>
<p>
“Shall we reach it, d’you think?”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t tell. The engines are good for a
few miles; how many I don’t know.”
</p>
<p>
“Vere am I?” said Schwab, awaking. “Ach!
I remember. Do ve soon arrive at ze yacht?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>
</p>
<p>
“We probably shan’t arrive at all,” replied
Tom. “One of the engines is failing.”
</p>
<p>
“But it muss not—it muss not! Surely ze
Photographic Sensitizer Preparation Number
Six vill not fail? Schlagintwert’s preparations
never fail; zat is ze foundation of zair business.”
</p>
<p>
“No; the preparation is all right; it’s the
engine.”
</p>
<p>
“Ach! it should have been made in Jarmany!
But, tell me true, Mr. Dorrell, are ve in danger?”
</p>
<p>
“The truth is, Mr. Schwab, that I can’t
guarantee the machine for another ten miles.”
</p>
<p>
“Ach! Vat vill I become? Vat vill Schlagintwert’s
become! Vy did you bring me in
zis bad-made airship from my captivity? If
you zere had left me, our Kaiser who is in Berlin
vould have sent a telegram to ze Sultan of
Marokko, and zen ve should see somezink. Zere
had I at least enough to eat.”
</p>
<p>
“Confound it!” cried Tom, thoroughly exasperated.
“We came to fetch Sir Mark Ingleton,
not you. But for you we should have been
halfway home to England by this time; and
but for your weight, we shouldn’t have been in
this pretty mess at all.”
</p>
<p>
Schwab’s jaw fell. This was an aspect of the
matter that had not occurred to him. Lifting
his waistcoat, and looking down, he said slowly—
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>
</p>
<p>
“Truly I vish I had not eaten so much biscuit!”
</p>
<p>
It was now getting dark. Tom steered towards
a bit of rough country to the north, again some
points out of his course, his object being to
worry the pursuers as much as possible and to
draw them away from the line of Abdul’s flight.
With great satisfaction he saw them follow. After
scattering over a wide area in search of the
fugitive whose disappearance had so much puzzled
them, they had again formed a compact body, and
pursued the airship in the belief that their
quarry must still be within touch of it. In a few
more minutes they were obliterated by the darkness;
but the sky was starry, and while on the
ground they were invisible from above, it was
probable that the airship was still visible to them.
</p>
<p>
Tom had noticed for some time past that
the wind, which had been slight and for the most
part in his favour during the day, was shifting,
and blowing with greater force. In the circumstances
the airship was making very little headway,
and Tom’s anxieties were further increased when
his sense of smell apprised him that the engines
were again becoming overheated. Even if the
airship were out of sight, the pursuers would
probably still hear the whirring of the propellers,
and it was advisable, both for the sake
of cooling the machinery and of depriving the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>
enemy of a clue, that the airship should once
more be brought to the ground. But it was
with some trepidation that Tom allowed it to
sink. He chose a spot just beyond a stretch
of woodland from which it was scarcely possible
that the vessel could have been seen. He
could only hope that the sound had not been
heard.
</p>
<p>
“I vish——” began Schwab, as they came to
rest.
</p>
<p>
“Shut up!” said Tom in a vehement whisper.
“Everything depends on our keeping perfect
silence now.”
</p>
<p>
In a few minutes the horsemen could be heard
approaching. They dashed past the trees behind
which the airship stood, and Tom’s heart beat
fast as he realized how very near the danger was.
But the riders did not pause, and the sound of
the horses’ hoofs gradually faded away.
</p>
<p>
“We’d better lie snug for a time,” said Tom.
“Perhaps the wind will moderate. I’m afraid
the exertion of overcoming it would do for the
engines altogether.”
</p>
<p>
While Oliphant held the electric torch,
carefully shaded, Tom again overhauled the
engines.
</p>
<p>
“The valve is sticking,” he said in a whisper.
“There is some grit between the stem and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>
sleeve. It must have got in at our last stop.
I shall have to take off the cover and file the
stem smooth.”
</p>
<p>
This was an operation of some difficulty; but
as it turned out there was time to spare, for
as the night wore on the force of the wind
rather increased than diminished. Schwab bemoaned
the lack of a pipe and beer; the others
were so tired and famished that they were
not provoked to either merriment or anger
by his complaints. He by and by again fell
asleep. Tom and Oliphant kept watch and
watch throughout the night. When Tom awoke
from an uneasy nap shortly before dawn, he
was relieved to find that the wind had dropped,
though its direction was still unfavourable. At
daybreak a start was made, and for a short
time the valve worked satisfactorily, thanks to
the large amount of oil used to counteract the
overheating. Then, however, the oil began
again to give off an unmistakable odour. The
airship was brought to ground, and Tom found
that the injured stem had become bent. With
infinite care, to avoid breaking it altogether,
Tom straightened it with a small hammer, and
again filed it smooth.
</p>
<p>
Once more the airship resumed its flight.
Fortunately there was no sign of the pursuers,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span>
and Tom hoped that Abdul had managed
to evade their clutches.
</p>
<p>
The country was very wild and deserted, and
Tom purposely steered some miles out of what
he thought was the true course, in order to avoid
the cultivated district that lay in the direct line
to the yacht. Suddenly, however, skirting the
shoulder of a hill, he came into full view of a
village, with the sea a few miles beyond.
</p>
<p>
“Thank Heaven!” ejaculated Oliphant, “we
may do it yet.”
</p>
<p>
“Surely that’s the very village you were
taken to with Ingleton,” said Tom, scanning the
place through his binocular. “Have a look.”
</p>
<p>
“By George! I believe you’re right. There’s
a whole host of Moors round it, too. They’ve
sighted us. They’re off!”
</p>
<p>
Taking the glass from him, Tom saw a body
of at least a hundred and fifty men galloping off
in a direction which would bring them between
him and the coast.
</p>
<p>
“Smother them!” he cried. “I wouldn’t
mind if we hadn’t to drop so often to cool.”
</p>
<p>
“Can’t we make one good dash for it? We’ve
only eight or nine miles to go, have we?”
</p>
<p>
“My dear fellow, we can’t do five miles at a
stretch—unless we drop Mr. Schwab.”
</p>
<p>
“Donnerwetter!” cried the German, starting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>
up in fright. “Vat you say? Vould you do
zat? Vould you desert? Vould you leave me,
a Jarman sobjeck, to be tore in piece by tousand
vile Mohrs, ven ze sea, ze sea vat sails ze Jarman
fleet, is so near, so near? But yes—I know
it! I alvays say so. Never trust an Englishman—egzept
in business!”
</p>
<p>
Tom treated this outburst with silent contempt.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t go at a higher speed than fifteen miles
an hour,” he said to Oliphant. “We’re perhaps
a mile nearer the sea than the Moors, but they
can equal our pace for a short distance, and I
know we’ll have to come down before we get
to the sea. If we do, we’ll be collared.”
</p>
<p>
“Risk a dash! It seems our only chance.”
</p>
<p>
Tom hesitated for a few moments. Then he
said, setting his teeth—
</p>
<p>
“All right. It’s the only thing to do.”
</p>
<p>
He put both engines at full speed, and Schwab
shouted with delight when he saw that the
airship was gradually drawing away from the
galloping Moors. But in ten minutes all three
were aware of the ominous smell. Was it possible
to reach the yacht, now clearly in view? Tom,
alert to catch the slightest indication of failure
on the part of the engines, hoped, doubted, hoped
again, but was resolved to hold on to the last.
</p>
<p>
Another five minutes passed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>
</p>
<p>
Then all were startled by a strange grinding
sound in the defective engine.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” asked Oliphant.
</p>
<p>
“It’s all up,” said Tom quietly. “The heat
has loosened the turbine blades, and they are
smashing to pieces.” Even as he spoke sheets
of flame shot from the exhaust pipe, accompanied
by a series of deafening reports.
</p>
<p>
Tom at once reduced speed, shouting to
Oliphant to adjust the planes for descent.
</p>
<p>
“Zink! Zink vat you do!” cried Schwab,
now almost frantic. “Zey vill have us! Ze
Mohrs vill cut our zroats! Vy—vy—vy——”
</p>
<p>
Tom paid no heed; Oliphant muttered under
his breath. They were sinking towards a ravine
through which a watercourse ran to the sea.
The engine, its parts grinding and tearing with
a hideous scrunching sound, was shooting out
flames, to the accompaniment of detonations like
those of a Maxim gun. Another minute or two
would witness a cataclysm; but Tom thought that
if the farther side of the ravine could be reached,
they might gain a little grace. The enemy would
have some difficulty in crossing at speed.
</p>
<p>
The engines were failing; the airship was
falling more and more rapidly.
</p>
<p>
“Can’t screw the planes any further!” cried
Tom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>
</p>
<p>
Oliphant wrenched at the lever; Tom put
the whole force of the second engine upon the
ascensional screws; and the rapidity of descent
was somewhat checked. The ravine was directly
beneath; Tom succeeded in giving the vessel a
last forward motion; then it came with a violent
bump to the ground, just on the further edge.
</p>
<p>
“Out! Quick!” cried Tom to Schwab, who
was bemoaning the shock he had suffered.
</p>
<p>
When all three stood safe on the ground, Tom
caught hold of the rails of the car.
</p>
<p>
“I made it; I’ll break it; <em>they</em> shan’t,” he
said, and he toppled the airship over into the
gulf, where it was smashed to atoms.
</p>
<p>
Then, with Oliphant at his side, and Schwab
labouring behind, with piteous entreaties that
they would not desert him, he dashed towards
the cliff, a mile away, beyond which was the sea.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span><a name='chXVII' id='chXVII'></a>CHAPTER XVII—COMPLIMENTS AND THANKS</h2>
<p>
While yet in the air, Tom had seen a
boat putting off from the yacht. The
vessel itself was no longer visible, concealed by
the intervening cliff; but the top of its mast,
with Mr. Greatorex’s ensign flying, could just
be seen. Towards this Tom led the way at
full speed. To go very fast was impossible over
the rough ground, but moderate as the pace was
it soon began to tell upon Schwab, who plunged
heavily along, tripping over tussocks of coarse
grass that grew here and there on the sandy soil.
Fierce pants could be heard by the two running
side by side in front of him, though, in spite of
his breathlessness, he managed to give utterance
every now and again to agonizing entreaties
that the others would not desert him. Moved
by these, and remembering the German’s game
leg, the others waited for him, and catching each
an arm, hurried him along between them.
</p>
<p>
Terror lent him strength and speed when the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>
foremost of the pursuers, arriving at the brink
of the ravine, which at that point they were
unable to cross, began to fire upon the fugitives.
Bullets whistled past, alarmingly near,
and Tom and Oliphant instinctively released
Schwab’s arms and moved apart, so as to present
a smaller target to the enemy. Meanwhile some
of the Moors had galloped up the bank of the
ravine in search of a crossing. Glancing round,
Tom was concerned to see that these horsemen
had disappeared; presumably they had found
a suitable crossing-place, and would soon again
be on his tracks. In a few moments they reappeared
on the nearer bank, and set off at a
gallop.
</p>
<p>
The Englishmen were now about a quarter
of a mile from the shore, Schwab having dropped
nearly a hundred yards behind, with another
quarter-mile between him and the horsemen.
There could be little doubt that the fugitives
would be overtaken before they reached the edge
of the cliff. Even if they contrived to scramble
down they might be snapped up under the
eyes of the yacht’s crew, should not the boat have
arrived. And what of the Moors who a day or
two ago, when Tom left the place, had been
encamped in the hollow of the cliff? Were
they still there?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span>
</p>
<p>
The question was answered almost as it occurred.
Tom suddenly noticed a horseman making towards
him from the left, followed closely by a
dozen others. It was with a gasp of amazement
that he recognized in the foremost rider no other
than Abdul. He came up at a breakneck pace,
sprang from his horse, and joined himself to the
fugitives. Immediately afterwards the Moors
were upon the little party. Leaping from their
horses while still in full career, they threw themselves
upon the four, and though Tom and
Oliphant each with a blow from his fist felled
a man, and Schwab threatened the vengeance
of the Kaiser, they were overwhelmed and flung
to the ground.
</p>
<p>
The Moors shouted with exultation, their
cries being answered jubilantly by the horsemen
coming up from the ravine. They were beginning
to bind their captives; but before a single
knot could be tied there came other shouts from
the direction of the sea.
</p>
<p>
“At them, men; bowl ’em over!”
</p>
<p>
Surely this was the voice of Mr. Greatorex!
A lusty British cheer answered him. With a
great effort Tom threw off the Moor who was
pinning him down, and sprang to his feet in
time to see a dozen sturdy seamen rushing from
the edge of the cliff. The Moors turned at bay,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>
but nothing could withstand the charge of the
British tars, wielding their clubbed rifles like
flails. In a few seconds half of the Moors were
on the ground with more or less broken heads;
the rest were in full flight.
</p>
<p>
But the other troop of horsemen was now
not more than a few hundred yards distant.
At a word from Captain Bodgers the sailors
flung themselves face downwards, ready to deal
with the second band.
</p>
<p>
“Aim at the horses!” cried Mr. Greatorex,
as he came panting up in the rear of his men, and
flopped down beside them.
</p>
<p>
A scattered volley brought half a dozen of
the advancing horsemen to the dust. The rest,
unable, owing to the rugged uneven ground, to
see with what force they had to contend, reined
up and hesitated. Another volley caused them
to draw off to some little distance, where they
formed a group and began to discuss how to
retrieve this unexpected check.
</p>
<p>
“Now for the boat, my lads!” cried Mr.
Greatorex.
</p>
<p>
Up sprang the men, and the whole body made
a dash down the cliff. Before the Moors had
agreed upon their course, the fugitives were
half-way down. Seeing now by how few men
they had been checked, the Moors came after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>
them at full speed. But by the time they reached
the edge of the cliff and dismounted the fugitives
were at the bottom.
</p>
<p>
At that moment there was a report and a
puff of smoke out at sea, and a shot, purposely
aimed high, flew over the cliff, and fell a little
to the rear of the Moors. That was the finishing
stroke. Their horses stampeded and dashed
straight for the ravine, the riders in wild pursuit
behind them. Three minutes afterwards Mr.
Greatorex had his whole party in the boat,
and the sailors, with a final rousing cheer, pulled
for the yacht.
</p>
<p>
Tom saw everything in a mist as he went
aboard. Worn out with the exertions and excitements
of the past few days, he was only vaguely
conscious of being fussed over, and treated, as he
said afterwards, more or less as a baby. He was
put to bed, slept heavily for several hours, and
awoke with a most exigent hunger. The yacht
was in motion. He rose, bathed, put on some
clean things, and, feeling himself again, thankfully
obeyed Mr. Greatorex’s hearty call to dinner.
</p>
<p>
Around the well-spread table he found the
rest of the party already seated. At the head was
Mr. Greatorex, with Sir Mark Ingleton at his
right; at the foot, Captain Bodgers with Herr
Schwab. The German had tucked his napkin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>
between his shirt and his waistcoat, and was
gazing with ecstatic anticipation through his
glasses at the covered entrée dishes just brought
in by Timothy.
</p>
<p>
Tom was taken aback, and not a little moved,
when Sir Mark Ingleton rose from his seat, and,
grasping his hand, said—
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, Mr. Dorrell. I have heard
the whole story from Mr. Greatorex and your
Moorish follower. It is not for me to speak of
the public service you have rendered; personally,
I owe you more than I can say, and I shall never
forget it.”
</p>
<p>
“So!” chimed in Schwab, rising stiffly from
his chair. His left hand gripped his fork; his
right enveloped Tom’s. “I zank you, for myself
personaliter, and for ze Kaiser, for Schlagintwert,
and for Business. Fill my glass, if you please,”
he added to Timothy, whose smile instantly
changed to a frown—“I vish to cry ‘Hoch!’
No, no, not too full, for ze ship moves, and ze
champagne vould slop over.”
</p>
<p>
Schwab’s intervention came in the nick of
time to relieve Tom’s embarrassment.
</p>
<p>
“Come, Tom, my <em>dear</em> fellow,” cried Mr.
Greatorex, “<em>sit</em> down. We were only waiting
for you.”
</p>
<p>
“Where’s Oliphant?” asked Tom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>
</p>
<p>
“Hm! <em>M’Cracken</em> is at the furnace,” replied
Mr. Greatorex.
</p>
<p>
“I say! That’s rough luck!” said Tom.
</p>
<p>
“It is by his own wish. I did violence to my
sense of what is <em>right</em> and <em>proper</em>, and invited him
to a place at our board. He showed, I must
say, a commendable sense of his <em>duty</em> in the
matter. ‘I’m M’Cracken and your stoker, sir,’
he said, ’till we get back to England.’”
</p>
<p>
“May I suggest,” said Sir Mark Ingleton,
“that a sense of the unfitness of his attire also
weighed with him?”
</p>
<p>
“We can soon alter that,” said Tom. “He’s
about my build; I’ll go and rig him out in one
of my suits.”
</p>
<p>
“Ve shall not vait to begin?” said Schwab
anxiously, holding knife and fork upright on the
table.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Oliphant will doubtless pardon us,”
replied Sir Mark blandly.
</p>
<p>
In a quarter of an hour Tom returned with
Oliphant in white ducks and blue serge.
</p>
<p>
“Still is zere somezink left,” said Schwab.
“I feel moch better, zough I vish ze table vould
not move. Do not fill your glass quite full, sir;
it vould slop over, and zat vould be pity.”
</p>
<p>
“Where’s Abdul?” asked Tom, as he sat
down.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span>
</p>
<p>
“With the men, forward,” said Mr. Greatorex.
</p>
<p>
“That’s all right. I’m jolly glad he got off
safely.”
</p>
<p>
“A most intelligent youth,” said Sir Mark.
“It appears that he rode straight into the village
of Salaam son of Absalaam with an urgent demand
for assistance from the sheikh of Ain Afroo. He
was leading a party of Moors in that direction
when unluckily a genuine messenger from the
sheikh arrived. Abdul wheeled about and galloped
for the shore, with the rest at his heels, as
you saw.”
</p>
<p>
“Shust in time,” said Schwab. “Vun moment
after, and I am no more.”
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t heard your story yet, sir,” said
Tom to the envoy.
</p>
<p>
“Story, bless you, I have none to tell. I was
on my way to Marrakesh, where the Sultan
was at the time, and was indiscreet enough one
evening to leave my camp for a stroll with only
one attendant. I was snapped up, enveloped
in a djellab, and conveyed on horseback—to my
great discomfort—to the sheikh’s kasbah. There
I had the good fortune to meet Mr. Schwab,
whose conversation, together with a Schlagintwert
price list and a copy of the <em>Daily Mail</em>, helped
to lighten the tedium of my captivity.”
</p>
<p>
“I zank you, Sir Ingleton,” said Schwab.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span>
“Alvays do I vish to be useful. <em>Utile et dulce.</em>
You vill not forget vat I say about extra-special
discount to ze nobility and gentry? And I
hear viz surprise, sir,” he added to Oliphant,
“zat you are son of a lord. Viz gompliments!”
</p>
<p>
He handed Oliphant a card from his case.
</p>
<p>
“Much obliged,” said Oliphant, kicking Tom
under the table. “How did they get hold of
<em>you</em>?”
</p>
<p>
“Vy, I tell you. I come to Rabat to buy
great lot of carpets for Schlagintwert. Zere
I hear zat ze Sultan is at Marrakesh, and I zink
I shall visit him. I egzpect big order for alarm
clocks and bianola. Zat vill be good business.
Ach! vat know ze Mohrs of business? Zey
seize me; zey care nozink ven I say I am Jarman
sobjeck; zey understand nozink ven I speak of
our Kaiser who is in Berlin; and so am I shut
opp. I smoke all my tobacco; zere is no more.
I read ze <em>Daily Mail</em>, and zink ven I gontemblate
ze advertisement vat colossal business is literature
in England. I read Schlagintwert’s price list,
and make notes for new edition; alas! zat muss
all be done again. Zen I do nozink but zink
profound, until Sir Ingleton come and ve study
ze list togezer.”
</p>
<p>
“An experience I shall always cherish, believe
me, Mr. Schwab,” said Sir Mark.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>
</p>
<p>
“I zank you, sir. Ze pleasure vas mutual;
ze profit shall be Schlagintwert’s.”
</p>
<p>
“But how was it you were put in the
dungeons?” asked Tom.
</p>
<p>
“Vy, I tell you. Vun day come ze sheikh
viz his men. Zink I, now has arrive ze Kaiser’s
telegram. But no; zey carry us down to ze
deps, and zere are ve shut opp vorse zan before!”
</p>
<p>
“That was when they got the message from
Salathiel ben Ezra, no doubt,” said Tom,“—the Jew you found in the cave, Mr. Schwab.”
</p>
<p>
“Ven I vas so hungry!”
</p>
<p>
“I wonder what has become of him?” said
Oliphant. “It’s to him I owe the keenest sport
I’ve ever had.”
</p>
<p>
“The less said about that the <em>better</em>, M’C—I
beg your pardon—Mr. Oliphant. The man
was a <em>villain</em>. I <em>said</em> so, Tom. Timothy will
have a <em>scar</em> for the rest of his days. And but for
the Jew we shouldn’t have lost our airship. Not
that that matters. We’ve <em>proved</em> it, you know;
we’ll build a larger one now.”
</p>
<p>
“And Schlagintwerts shall buy it cost price!”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir, Schlagintwerts shall <em>not</em> buy it,”
said Mr. Greatorex, frowning severely on the
German. “We will offer it to the Government.
I shall invite Colonel Capper to examine it, and
Lord Langside, I trust, will show himself sufficiently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span>
sensible of his obligation to us to make no
difficulties about the <em>price</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“Vell, Schlagintwert shall have colossal order
for Photographic Sensitizer Preparation Number
Six—at least until ze var come.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>What</em> war?”
</p>
<p>
“Vy, ze var ven ze Kaiser shall zink it is time
to teach ze vorld zat——”
</p>
<p>
“Stay, Mr. Schwab,” interrupted Sir Mark,
“we must not be indiscreet. As a diplomatist
it is my duty to avert war; as a business man
you, I am sure, would deplore it.”
</p>
<p>
“So. Zat is shust vat I alvays say: zat is
vat I go to say ven you interrup me; ven ze
Kaiser shall zink it is time to teach ze vorld zat
Business are Business!”

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
